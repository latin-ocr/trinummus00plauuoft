CA. Larem corona nostrum decorari volo:

40 uxor, venerare ut nobis haec habitatio

bona fausta felix fortunataque e‘venat —
teque ut quam primum possim videam em6rtuam.

42. Ritschl writes possit with Lambinus, instead of possim os
the mss„ which is however sufficiently defended by analogous
passages which it would be perverse to alter: see 11. on Au1. 119

and Ter. Andr. 861.

adjectival suffix being ontio-
(Corssen 1 62), it first became
onso-‚ which passed into osso-
by way of assimilation, and
finally settled down to oso-‚
though even in Virgil and Ho-
race the forms seem to fluctuate:
see Corssen 11 186, and Rib-
beck's Ind. gramm. in the first
vol. of his Virgil, p. 434.

38. remora is a word proba-
bly first formed by Plautus ; he
has it again Poen. 1v 2, 106
(=918 Geppert); Festus quotes
it also from Lucilius (quaenam
vox ex tete resonans meo yradzc
remoram facit? xxv-1 52, p. 84
ed. L. Muller), and writers of
the silver period have it again.
Ovid Met. 111 567 says remora-
men.

Sc. 11. (39). Callicles comes
out of his newly-bought house
and at first gives his wife orders
as to the festive decorations
due to the Lar of the house.
It was the custom to pay spe-
cial respect to the Lar on any
festive occasion or whenever an
event took place in the family
over whose welfare he was sup-

(Sp. justly keeps the ms. reading.)

posed to preside. In this way,
a Lar is decorated with wreaths
and flowers at a departure(Merc.
834 sq.) and on a retum (Stich.
534), and even the miser Euclio
buys an offering to his Lar on
the approaching nuptials of his
daughter: Aul. 383. In the
present instance it was neces-
sary to implore the favour and
the blessing of the Lar on ac-
count of the change of residence.

40. venerari is useda-bsolutely,
‘to pray ’ to the gods. This

use of the word is very frequent ⁴

in Pl. (Aul. prol. 83 Rud. 11 1,
163 v 2, 62; Poen. v 1, 17, and
with an alliteration venerari
Venerem ib. 1 2, 66); in one
place, Bacch. 173, we find also
an active form (veneroque, ete),
comp. Hor. Sat. 11 2, 124.

41. evenat for eveniat is clear-
ly due to metrical necessity:
the same form occurs Mil. gl.
1010, Epid. 11 2, 105, Cure. 39,
Pompon. 35 and Enn. trag.
170; so also advenae Pseud.
130, per-venat Rud. 626, perve-
παηι below 93, and evenant
Cure. 125.
