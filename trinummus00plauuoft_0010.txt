vi PREFACE.

But Ritschl's own emendation placidula which he had
proposed in his first edition, is too pleasing and too much
in the true style of our poet, to be easily exchanged for
an uncouth placicled.

“ It remains to say a word on the hiatus. In general,
I may state that the sweeping corrections proposed by
O. F. W. Miiller and the attempt made by Ritschl to
obviate the hiatus by introducing a final d, after which
there would still be left a number of refractory passages,
have confirmed my former conviction as to the admissi-
bility of hiatus in the caesura and when the line is
divided among two or more speakers (Into-od. to Aul.
p. Lx). But a new instance of hiatus should be added
to those previously collected in my Introduction to the
Aulularia: viz. hiatu-s before α’ cretio word ab the end of
α line, such as we have it in V. 539 of the present play—

nam fulguritae sunt alternae arbores.

“This kind of hiatus was first pointed out by Spengel,
and Brix adopted it in his note on Ilien. 473-

pranffl, potavi, scortum accubui: apstuli

and in a trochaic line, ib. 1160—

vaenibunt servi, supellex, aedes, fundi: omnia.

In the first place, it is evident that a correction would
, spoil the style of the passage—though G. F. W. Miiller,
who is up to anythjng‚ has the audacity to propose
two conjectures5 m. that we should insert either inde
or ei. In the second line it is just possible that Plautus
wrote fandis or fundcis (even fundes), as Bucheler says
in his valuable treatise on Latin Declension p. 18¹), but
it is far from being proven.

“A similar instance of hiatus occurs Capi. 478 (Brix)-—

neque me rident. ‘fibi cenamus! mquam atque ilfi-abnuont
where I should assume a short pause to express the
³ See also RitschL N. P. E. the first idea of rehabflitating

1 114. It may be observed that the final d from an observation
Ritschl seems to have derived of Biicheler, Lat. Deci. p. 47.
