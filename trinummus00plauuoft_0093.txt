538. The mss. AB read a me, but Plautus never uses audire
ab aliquo, but only ex aliquo. Kampmann and Ritschl write,
therefore, ez· me. [The reading of OD omnia mea would appear
to be merely due to emendation. though Ι formerly admitted
it in my text. I have now adopted Sp.'s emendation ante, a
word easily obtained out of a men] 539. Π Ritschl had not added
an explanation, it would be embarrassing to guess his intention
in putting a form alternas¹ in his text: but it is actually meant for
a nom. plur. There is, however, not a single trace of this nom.
plur. in as in the mss of Plautus: and the line quoted by Ritschl
(N. Exc. p. 117) has long since been explained by merely adding
a. note of exclamation: quo‘t. laetitias insperatas! mo‘clo mi inrep-

534. quoium is explained as
a gen. plural masc. and fem.
by Charisius p. 162, 2 K, and
Biicheler on Latin decl. p. 46
quotes from the Lex agraria
l. 90 mim quis ferto quo quis
eoram, quoium eum ayrum esse
oportet, eum ayrwn habeat.
(quoium B, cuium A, ciuium C,
cuius D: the usual reading
quorum is a conjecture by Sara-
cenus.) See also wordsworth‘s
Specimens of Early Latin, p.

535. The old form exolutum
(or exol.) is in this place attest-
ed by the palimpsest and No-
nius who quotes this line p.
123, 20. ezsolatum is given by
B Mero. 593, escol. by the same
ms. Pseud. 1035.—emortui ‘ dead
and gone'‚ a more emphatic
word than mortui. Cicero has
the verb emori Off. 111 32, 6
and de rep. 1v ap. Lactant.

Inst. v 11.-1n enumerations
like the present, sunt may be
omitted even in the comio
style.

537. aaz incitas ‘ad sum-
mam rerum perturbationem
desperationemque' Glossae Pla-
cidi, p. 434. The same expres-
sion occurs Poen. 11 2, 26.—This
expression was originally used
of a game when one of the
players was ⁶ checkmate ’ in not
being able to move one of his
figures; he was then ad irzeitas
(sc. calces) redactus.- incitus
meaning ‘immoveable’‚ from
ciere, the technical term of
moving the figures on the
heard—istum ayrum ‘that land
of yours'.

ning were considered accursed
and unholy, and were fenced
in. Trees struck by lightning
