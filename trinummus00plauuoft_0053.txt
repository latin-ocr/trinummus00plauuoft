multum in cogitando dolorem indipisoor.

225 egomet me coquo et macero et defetigo3

magister mihi exercitos animus nuno est.

225, 6. Ritschl considers these two lines as dittographies, but
though they may be such, it wffl be extremely difficult to prove

that they must be such.

Acr Π, Sc. 11. Acanticum
or lyricad monologue contain-
ing the reasons that might
determine a young man to
settle down to an order-ly life
from the very beginning, with-
out first ‘sowing his wild
oats'.

223. The form simitu is
given by the Plautine mss. in
several places (Ritschl‚ Proll.
1). 143), and attested hythe old
Plautine 31035515Γ (id. Opusc.
11 558 sq.): it belongs clearly
to the same root as simul and
sim-ilis„ i. e. sama (English
same, Greek ἅμα) ‘one'‚ see
Corssen 1 p. 376; but might
not, as Prof. Key suggests, itu
stand instead of icta, simitu
meaning ‘ at one stroke ³ ξ)

224. indipisci is in the comic
writers more frequent than a·
dipisci or the simple verb
apisci.- in later writers, it is
found in Lucretius, Livy, Gel-

lius and Apuleius3 see n. on
Aul. 768. Neue 11 p. 273.

225. coquere in poetica] lan-
guage means ‘to vex, trouble,
excite’: so Enn. ann. 340, (cura)
qnae nnnc te coquit et versat.
Virg. A. vu 345, femineae ar-
dentem curaeque iraeque coque-
bant.-maccrare is frequently
used in this way by Plautus:
maceror maerore he has Capt.
1 2, 24; Cist. 1 1, 60. (Ep. 111. 1,
2.) maceravi me curis et lacrimis
Capt. v 1, 7.—defeti9arc is
given by the best mss. of Plau-
tus and Terence and seems to
have been the only form in use
in archaic Latin: but Cicero
and Caesar use both clefiztiqo
and clefetiyo: Fleckeisen, 50
Artikel p. 16. For analogous
compound verbs in which an
original a passes into ane, see
