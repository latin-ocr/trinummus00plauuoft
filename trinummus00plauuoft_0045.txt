Ι. 2. lle—121] TRINVMMVS. 29

id solus solum per amicitiam et per fidem
flens me opsecravit suo ne gnato crederem,

155 neu quoiquam unde ad eum id posset permanascere.
nunc si ille huc salvos revenit, reddam suom sibi.
siquid eo fuerit, ce'rte illius filiae, 120
quae mihi mandatast, habeo dotem ei {inde dem,

is, however, splen'didly emended by Ritschl: vel ibi qui hosticas
[⁴hastis’ the mss] trium nummum causa subeunt sub falas,
156. Only the Italian text (represented by F) reads redierit
instead of revenit, and it is rather strange that Ritschl should
consider this reading important enough to mention Koch's con-
jecture rediet which is based upon it. But of this conjecture it
may well be said that it is impossible to build a good house on
a rotten foundation. [For the (un-Plautine) form rediet see
Bitschl's note on v. 265] 158. The mss, do not give ei, which
was added by Ritschl, Par. p. 526: in his new edition he reads
eunde, a form merely assumed by him to avoid the hiatus. See
11. on cubi v. 934. There is no doubt that eunde was the
original form of the pronoun in Latin, but it survives only in
eompounds, e. g. alicunde. (Sp. reads ut inde. But is it good
Latin to say habeo ut inde, unless there be an object after

habeo 22)

(μνᾶ) being valued at five Phi-
lippei (see flealdi, Staatshaus-
halt 1 p.23). On the constant
shortening of the second syllable
in Plautus see my Introd. to the
Aul. p. XL111.——ad ‘about'z see
on v. 873.

153. id is the object of cre-
derem. id does not specially
refer to thensaurus (see on v.
405), but to the whole fact re-
lated v. 150 and 151.

155. pernzanczscere is a ἅπ.
λε’γ. The inchoative expresses
the slow, gradual, and secret
spreading of the neWS.

156. si...⁷·evenit ‘if he re-
returns'3 the present indicative
expresses the speaker’s cert-ain
hope of the fulfilment of this
condition, while 111 the next

line we have fuerit to express
doubt. suom. sibi expresses only
one notion ‘his own '. sibi is fre-
quently added in the comio lan-
guage to the possessive pronoun
to enforce its meaning: see my
n. on Ter. Ad. 958. Brix quotes
Poen. v 2, 123 suam sibi rem
salvam sistam, and even from
Cicero, Phil. 11 37, 96 prius
quam τιι suum sibi venderes.

157. siquid eo fucrit ‘if any-
thing should happen to him',
εἴ τι πείθοι, a euphemism for
εἰ ἀποθάνοι (111 German ‘ uena
rihm was ‘menschliches beyeynet').
With the present passage comp.
especially Poen. v 2, 125 quin
mea quoque iste habebit, siquid
me suat. Enn. ann. 128 siquid
me faerit humanitas.
