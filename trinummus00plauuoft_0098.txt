576. fortunare ‘est prospe-

Nonius p. 109, 14; the word
occurs in such good wishes
as the present in Cicero and
Horace. —z'ta volo ‘ I hope so'.

577. coram in the presence
of the parties concerned, i. e.
Lysiteles and yourself (the
young lady's opinion is not
asked, her consent being con-
sidered a matter of course).

578. eadem (abl, the first
two syllables being contracted by
synizesis) ‘ on the same occa-

should use the subj. in classical

pendent on (lic and similar im-
peratives is not felt as an incli-
rect question in early Latin.
Comp. e. g. Men. 143, die milui
env unquam ῖιι vidisti, where we
might use a colon instead of
the comma. In such instances
we may also (as Brix does) con-
sider hoc nepoti as the object
of (lic (per prolepsin), to which
quo modo actumst is added as
an epexegetic sentence.

581. scilicet is ironical ‘that
is a matter of course': you
might have saved yourself the
trouble of telling me to con-
gratulate your sister.
