625. Stasimus is surprised
that two such gentlemen as
Lesbonicus and Lysiteles should
conduct themselves in the street
in such an undiguified manner:
slaves might run and walk fast,
but a man of free birth would
as a matter of course walk slowly.
For euscheme cf. Mil. gl. 213,

it appears that ille (v. 624)
means Lysiteles. occultassis:
