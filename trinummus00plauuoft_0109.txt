ΠΙ. 2. 30—37.] TRINVMMVS. 93

{it rem patriam et gloriam maiorum foedarim
meum. 30

scibam ut esse me' deceret, facere non quibam
miser:

ita vi Veneris vietus, otio aptus in fraudem incidi.

se'd tibi nuuc, proinde {it merere, sumniam habebo
gratiam.

aga?{'gom1.Apmns A, which I think means otio aptus (anghilg
R, Sp.)‚ but BCD have otio captus. 659. See exeg. note. Sp.
has et at the beginning of the line, which has been corrected by

Brix. 660. dicta R, corde Sp. The mss, combine both, thus

vinctus the mss, followed by Sp.; victus R.

corrupting the metre.

656. ut commences an epexe-
gesis of istaec—foedare is sai]
by a zeugma, as rem foedare
cannot be said by itself.

657. For scibam see 11. 011
Aul. 49.

658. aptus ‘conexum et col-
ligatimi significat’‚ Nonius p.
234. ‘comprehendere' antiqui
vinculo apere dicebant Paul.
Diacon. pp. 18, 19. ’

659. It 13 only now that
Lesbonicus understands Lysi-
teles’ motive in refusing to ac-
cept his land. The mss. read
summas habeo matius .· but
Plautus always has qratia in
the singular, meaning ‘ thanks',
or yrates in the plural.

(360. haec dicta ‘ my words'.

661. piget drops its final
t.- Introd. to Aul. p. xxxw.

662. For postremo see n. on

613.—ans·cultare, meaning ‘to
obey' (origin. ‘to lencl an ear
to ⁷), always governs the dative,
whence Freund. justly wrote mi
here instead of me of msa—We
should explain ita sacis ut dieo,-
comp. Mero. 554, hoc ut dieo
factis persequar.

663. Brix explains this as an
allusion to one of the habits of
the scurrae (v. 20⁴2) which is
mentioned Poen. 111 2, 35 faei-
mzt, scurrae quod consuerunt:
pone sese homines locant. They
used to place their ‘umbrae or
parasites behind 30 that they
could not be easily perceived.
If so, the present expression is
still an ὀξύμωρον, as it would
mean that Lesbonicus places
his dissolute scis before his
respectability and thereby ob-
scures himself.
