dicebat, nunc hic quom 6pus est non quit dicere.
505 LE. quom adfinitate v6stra me arbitramini
dignum, habeo vobis, Philto magnam gratiam. 105
sed si 113έο res graviter cecidit stultitia mea,
Philto, est ager sub urbe nobis: eum dabo
dote'm sorori: nam is de divitiis meis
510 solus superfit praeter vitam relicuos.
PH. profecto dotem nil moror. LE. certumst dare.11o
ST. nostiamne‚ ere, vis nutricem, quae nos educat,
abalienare a n6bis'2 cave sis feceris.
' quid edemus nosmet p6stea? LE. etiam tu taces?

Introd. to Aul. p. xxrv. To avoid this, Bitschl admits Linde-
mann’s transposition dicto m'l erat usus. Sp. has a new reading
71ίί usus aba· erat (licto. 509. The mss. read (Ze stultitiis meis
(or the sing), but as in that reading the preposition de would

be quite meaningless, Ι have adopted Bergk's ingenious emenda-
tion which has also met with Ritsehi‘s [not with Sp.'s] approba-

tion 111 his second edition.

in other instances when Les-
bonicus ought rather to have
refrained from saying ‘ spondeo'
(v. 427 sqq.)‚ he was ready
enough with it; but now that a
profitable sponsio presents itself,
he hesitates and will not say
the word—An engagement was
considered as a verbal contract
or stipulatio, in which spondeo
was the word used to confirm
the transaction.

504. hic is the adverb: in hac
re. (It is difficult to see why
Ritsom should call this ‘per-
quam incommodum' and ex-
change it for hoc, a mere 0011-
jecture3 nunc hic is sm‘ely no
mere tautologyoe hic corresponds
to ubi in the preceding line,
and nunc enforces the notion
of the present time 111 oppo-
sition to the imperfect dicebat.)

505. quom stands, as it often
does 111 the 31011310 writers,

where later usage would have
required qnod or quoniam.

507. haec res ‘my fortune'
(see above, v. 172).—9raviter
cecidit ‘has collapsed heav11y',
:periit funditus.

508. sub urbe ‘outside the gates
oi the town’5 hence suburbanus,
and the English subztrb.

510. superfit: superest, oc-
curs in Plautus, Pseud. 456,
Stich. 592, Mil. gl. 356; a-
mong later writers Columella
has it xn 1, 5.

511. certumst ‘1 am resolv-
ed': see n. 011 v. 270.

513. cave is generally a pyr-
rhich in Plautus: Introd. to
Aul. p. xxvn.

514. etiam tu taces? ‘won’t
you be silent?' etiam is ex-
pressive os anger and vexation
at Stasimus' presumption 111
interfering with the whole
affair.
