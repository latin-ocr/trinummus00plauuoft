375. autem is om. in the mss, and was added by Fritzsche;
on account of the common pronunciation of αα as ο this word
could easily be omitted after date: it is far more expressive of
Philto's surprise than sine (loce uxot-amne! which is Ritschl's
reading. Sp.'s reading—‘sine doce acroventu-1 do not under—

stand.

373. In illum we may ob-
serve a prolepsis of the subject
of the dependent sentence.
For other instances see v. 88,
698, 872, 960, 9923 Capt. 3733
Men. 246, 881.

374. yrandis virgyo seems to
be the usual expression for a
girl of marriageable age: see
n. on Aul. 189, and comp. Ter.
Ad. 673, Andr. 814. Comp. also
adulta virgo in Hor. Carm. 111

376. The latest editor of this
play, A. Spengel, has preferred
reading the whole line as one
sentence, by omitting the punc-
tuation after salva. But on
account of the importance which
this consideration would possess

idi· such a character as Philto.
we think that a elever actor
would naturally pause after the
word salva to watch its effect
upon Philto, before he adds a
second reason. tua re salva
‘ without any expense to you ‘.

378. vt patiar, sc. ducere.

379. lepidam: n. on Aul.
493; where it should be added
that the word occurs also in
Phaedrus and Martial. It is
also well known as a proper
name.

380. docta dicta ⁴ wise saws',
occurs also Asin. 111 1, 22 and
Men. 249.-et quamvis facunde
‘and even ever so eloquently':
similar passages for quamvis
are Bacch. 339, Merc. 3185 cf.
