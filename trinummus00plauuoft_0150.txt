TRINVMMVS.

[IV. 2. 162—3. 4.

numquam edepol temere tinnit tintinnabulum:

1005 nisi qui illud tractat aut movet, mutumst, tacet.

sed quis hic 031, qui huc in plateam cursuram incipit?

lubet opservare quid agat: huc concessero.

quom abiisti domo.

cave sis tibi, ne bubuli in te cottabi crebri crepent,

1005. Ritschl brackets 11113 11110 ‘ut male confictum prioris

interpretamentum '.

If it were 30, 11 would at all events not be

‘male confictum', only observe the alliteration in tractat and
tacet, and in movet and mutnmst,· also the asyndeton at the end
of the line, which 13 quite in conforniity with Plautine style. Sp.

has again omitted R. ’3 brackets.

1009. metus 13 1110 reading of

the 11133. justly maintained by Sp.; malum 13 Koch’s conj. adopted

by R. and inadvertently admitted into my first edition.

At the

end of the line, tua is omitted in the 11133, added by Camerarius.

1004. tintinnabulum 3001113
always 10 be spelt with 71η 111
1110 second syllable, but the
verb 13 both tintinare and τίη-
tinum-e.

1005. nisi qni stands for wisi
quis 257.

1006. cursuram incipere seems
10 occur only herc.

1007. concessero instead of
concedam, in accordance with
1110 habit of early Latin.

Sc. 111. Stasimus has been
with 1113 boon companions and
returns home in time to inform
his master Charmides of the
state of his affairs, at least
according to the slave's idea of

them.

1008. propere celerem is a
tautology which serves to en-
force 1110 meaning, ‘make very
very great haste'. Observe also
the alliteration ‘dominum clo-
mum'. By (lominus 110 means
of course Lesbonicus.

1010. addere yradum ‘to
move more quickly ' 13 a phrase
used also by Livy x 20, xxvl 9
and Pliny Ep. VI 20. (Gronov.
Lect. Pl. p. 348. )-1]1ιοηι, ‘ 311100 ’:
cf. Ter. Haut. 54, inde adeo
quom aarum in proxumo Ιιὶσ

to have changed the reading).
