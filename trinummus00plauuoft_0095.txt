TRINVMMVS. 79

545 ΡΗ. credo ego 1313110, Stasime, ita esse: sed Cam-
panse crenus
multo Surorum iam antidit patie'ntiam.1÷5

sed is est ager profecto, ut te audivi loqui,
malos in quem omnis publice mitti decet:
sicut fortunatorum memorant insulas,

550 quo cuncti, qui aet-atem egerint caste suam,

conveniant3 contra istoc detrudi maleficos 150
aequom videtur, qui quidem istius sit modi.

547. istest Sp. with the mss. and this is indeed quite possible,
though I still prefer Rsss and Bothe's emendation.

sumus, Epist. 11 1, 36 scriptor
abhinc annos centum qui de-
cidit.

545. istuc ‘that which you
Say’. -— Campans ‘pro Campa-
num’ is attested by Nonius p.
486, 24 and by A: Brix justly
compares Picens and Pi cenas.—
The unfortunate inhabitants of
Capua had, aiter an unsuccess-
ful rebellion, experienced the
full rigour of the Roman se-
ate, and a. 211 (at least twenty
years before the performance of
the Trinummus) a considerable
number of citizens had been
sold as slaves. The taunt im-
plied in the present passage is
very bitter and unfeeling : Philto
says that now (iam, after the
lapse of twenty years) the for-
merly luxurious inhabitants oi
Capua have become so inured
to the degrading treatment of
slaves and to hard work as to
surpass even the Syriam—See
also Mommsen, H. oi Rome 1
(339 (sec. ed.)

545. antidit = anteit, is a.
compound repeatedly found in
Plautus: Cas. 111 2, 9 qui posc-
quam amo Casinam, ‘magyis mnn-
dis (sQ G. Hermann) munditiis

Ὀλβιοι ἥρωες,

munditiam antideo. Cistell. 11
1, 3 qui omnis homines supero
antideo crzcciabilitutibus animi.
Bacch. 1089, soliis eyo omnis
101190 antideo stultitia et moribus
moris, according to which line
we should not hesitate in cor-
recting Persa 779, solas esso om-
nis facile antideo (the mss.
have omnibus antideo facile).
Terence never uses this form.
—The old fonn of the preposi-
tion‚ antid, is in origin an abla-
tive: Corssen 1 199, 734. See
above v. mei—The usual form
anteit occurs Amph. 11 2, 18.

551. istoc=in istum agrum,
whence also qui in the next
line.

doubt on Philto’s part as to the
truth oi Stasimus' exaggerated
description. (We should take.
