yemcs qui r. tuom, which has clearly got here from v. 678. Sp.
adheres to the mss. 677. atquc Sp. with the mSS. (cf. 652).
682. rem being a monosyllable and following a disyllabic word
becomes enclitic. We should not, therefore, change the ms. read-

681. For the omission of ut
before the subj., see n. on v. 591.

682. porro ‘in future’.—2·n
ditiis is an exaggerated expres-
