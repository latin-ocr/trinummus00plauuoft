[1. 1. 4-10.

conce'tstigabo pro conmerita noxia:

invitus, ni id me invitet ut faciem fides. 5
nam hic nimium morbus 1116105 invasit bonos:

ita plerique 01111115 iem sunt intermortui.

30 sed dum illi aegrotant, interim mores mali

quasi herba inrigua succrevere ube'rrume :
neque quicquam hic vile nunc est nisi mores mali. 10

29. omnis.- this form of the nominative plur. is here given by
the best mss. BCD, while the paliinpsest reads homines. Comp.

below v. 212. 307.

See for these forms in -z's Munro's observa-

tions in the second edition of 1115 Lucretius, p. 38, and numerous
instances collected by Lachmann Comm. Lucr. p. 56 sqq. In-
stances 110111 inscriptions are given by Corssen 1 746 sq.

2⁵3. He pur-posely chooses here
stronger expressions than in 1115
first line: coz<casti9are and 0011-
merita nomia. Comp. the ana-
logous expression commereri cul-
pam Aul. 711, Capt. 400, and
see Ter. Haut. 83 with mynote.

27. The jingle inritus-...inri-
tet belongs to the many alli-
terations and assonances pecu-
liar to the langunge of Plautus
and which he no doubt took
from popular speech. He a·
bounds 111 happy and effective

ι combinatione of words of the

same or similar sound: the pre-
sent is a very excellent instance
on account of the opposite
meaning being made more pro-
minent by the similarity of
sound. Hence our poet has the
same pun again, Rud. 811.—
invitus 50. 1100 facio [neque
faciani} ni me invitet etc. Ob-
serve also the allitei'ation in
faciam fides, In the next line
we have (1110011)ν morbus mores,
28. hic, i. e. here, which would
110 doubt be understood of Rome.
Allusions to Rome and Roman
laws and. cust-oms are of frequent

occurrence in Plautus, notwith-
standing the general Greek cha-
racter of 1115 plays. Terence
manifeste a pnrer style of com-
position by avoiding them.—

below 34, 931, 1060 and other
passages, in which the tendency
10 exaggerate peculial* to con-
versational expressions is very
conspicuous, collected. in Ram-
say’s Mostellaria p. 234.

nom. pl. omnis see crit. notes,—
intermortztos ‘swooning away':
from intermori01·‚ a verb used
by Cato, Pliny and Celsus, in
which the preposition inter has
the same power as in interne-
care (Pl. Amph. 1 1, 35). The
word occurs only here in Plautus.
