apage amor, non places, nil te utor.
quamquam illud est dulce, esse et bibere,
amor amari dat tamen

satis quod aegrest:
fugit forum, fugat tuos cognatos,
fugat ipsus semet ab suo contutu

membra’ of the genuine reading3 Ritschl gives Ιιαὲε eqo quom
cum meo [mimo reputo [et recolo . . . .] . . . . Ι have added rec-
tius at the end of the line, suggested, of course, by rectilo in
B, but recommended also by the threesold alliteration and the
frequent use Plautus makes of this word: see e. g. v. 50.

257 b. Ι follow the reading of the mss„ Bitschl has ub} qui eyet,
preti quam sit parvi, as a bacch. trim. acatal, but in his note he

recommends ubi quisque eget quam preti sit perparvi. For the
shortening of the genetival suffix in preti see Introd. to the Aul.
p. xxv. 258. apage, amor is the reading of Donatus on Ter. Eun.
1v 6, 18; our mss, add te in the second place: Ritschl writes ἄραρε
amor, πόη places, ‘nil ego ted ator, but the mss. have no eqo and
agree in giving te. By keeping the reading of Donatus and the
mss, we obtain a line corresponding in metre to the preceding, and
a short trochaic mette will be found highly appropriate after the
trochaic septenarius 2572.. For the shortening in place's see
Introd. to the Aul. p. xxxvu sq. 259. I have marked this line
as an iambic dimeter hypercat.‚ the next as an iambic dimeter
catal„ and the third as a dipodia iambica hypercatal. A system
of iambic lines seems to me quite in its place after the tro-
chaic system which precedes—The mss read est dulce, which
I have kept in preference to Ritsehl's dulcest. Comp. the Eng-
lish rendering ‘though indeed it is pleasant‚’ where we naturally
lay a stress on is, and the same would be the case in Latin.
261. tuos is in all probability the reading of the palimpsest, the
other mss. having vos. Camerarius was the first editor who wrote
tuos. 252. In accordance with the preceding line I have here
gained the same metre (tripodia iamb. cat. Δ.- trip. iamb. acat.:
see Studemund de canticis p. 29) by a slight change based on the
reading of the palimpsest sztyat ipsas sem ab sao, where sem clearly
means semet, as was suggested by Ritschl in his first edition.
