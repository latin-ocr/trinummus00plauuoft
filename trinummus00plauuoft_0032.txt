55 CA. eho tii, tua uxor quid agit? ME. inmortalis est:
vivit victuraquest. CA. bene hercle nuntias,
deosque oro ut vitae tuae superstes suppetat.

ΜΕ. dum quidem hercle tecum nupta sit, sane velim.
CA. vin conmutemus2 tuam ego ducam et tu meam!

61. 1 have adopted Geppert's excellent emendation of the
reading given by A: namque enim te (ιίι the other msS.) credo mi:
comp. Rud. v 3, 30 sq. iam te γαειιέ Nanctum hominem quem.
(let'rudares. Ritschl reads nempe enim tu, credo, me, his changes
being by no means easier than those admitted by Geppert, and the
sense he obtains decidedly inferior in point. Sp. retains the text
of the mss. BGD, which Ι believe to be quite inadmissible. Comp.
v. 63, in which we should now assume vzanctzt's to be said with a

kind of sneer.

Aul. 137, and cf. below v. 75.

55. Comp. Philemon fragm.
(p. 426 Mein.)‚ ἀθάνατόν ἐστι
κακὸν ἀναγκαῖον γυνή.

57. Τ116 alliteration superstes
suppetat renders the expression
highly effective. suppetit means
‘it is sufficient': so As. 1 1, 42
mm suppetunt dictis data ‘his
gifts are not sufficient in 60111-
parison with his words', i. e.
are not proportionate to his
words. See also Pseud. 108
utinam, quae dieis, (lictis fucta
suppetant. The dative vitae is
dependent both on superstes and
the verb: for the sense comp.
also Persa 331, ut mim· supersit,
suppetat, superstitet.

53. For the scansion of (lum
quidem hercle see Introd. to the
Aul. p. xnvl.

60. facco ‘Iwarrant you': the
subjunctive in the dependent
clause is 111 this sense not
so frequent as the future ind:

see n. on Ter. Ad. {HR—haud
tantillum ‘not the veryleast bit':
phrases like this are always ac-
companied by the speaker with
a gesture showing their real
meaning—verba clare ‘cheat,
deceive': n. on Aul. 62.-—-This
line is perfectly natural in the
mouth of Callicles, Megaronides
having previously eomplainecl
of his curst wife, v. 54.

61. obrepere is here and below
974 joined with the accusative,
though 111 later Latin it always
takes the dative (Cicero joins it
with ad or im: the Plautino
construction is, however, imi-
tated by the writer of the prol.
to the Poenulus, 14, tacitum te
obrepet fames. See Drager 1
351 and 3s6. In the same way,
Plautus has occursare with the
