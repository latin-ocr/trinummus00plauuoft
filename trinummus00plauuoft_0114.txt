693. conlntulentet si is no doubt indicated by the reading of
BG conlntulent et si.- the true form of the verb has first been
pointed out by a Norwegian scholar, Bugge, who justly quoted
the analogous formatioris of opulentare and turbulentare: all
editions before Bitschl⁷ 5 read conlzctulet. The word conlutulentare
is, moreover, warranted by Placidus in A. Mais Clas 5. auct. 111
p. 478 and vi 565, as Brix observes. See above, v. 292. 700 eum
agrum Sp.‚ but eum is in B added above the line, though by an
old hand3 Bentley appears to have been the first to omit eum.

695. dictatorem is said in
agreement with Roman man-
ners; the Greek original pro-
bably had βασιλέα. Lesbonicus
rejoins, as if Lysiteles had
meant external honour and dig·
nity in v. 694, while honor there
denotes ‘ respectabih'ty'.

696. Lesbonicus purposely
uses three synonyme to render
his assertion very emphatic.

697. pudico ‘a man of ho-
nour’: the expression is an in-
tentional allusion to Lysiteles'
words v. 661.

698. te is an instance of pro-
lepsis: cf. 373.—F0r subolet

sentio see above, 615.

700. qni vitam colas ‘ to sus-
tain your life' :qui υῐυαε 561.

701. inanis ‘penniless’. Ob-
serve the alliteration in ‘ pro-
fug-us patriam'.

702. The emphasis implied
in the addition of this line has
escaped Bitschl so much that
he actually considers it to be
an interpolation.-—c·09natos al-
ludes especially to his sister,
adfinitatem (the collective term
:adfinem to Lysiteles and Phil-
to, and amicos is a general term
more comprehensive than the
two that precede.
