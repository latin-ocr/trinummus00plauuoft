writer would use reddere—The
sense is: a man who conducts
himself lightly to his own
family, will never acquire gra-
vity in the eyes of strangers.

685. ‘nolo te iactari “do not
trouble (vex) yourself about it’.
Lambinus justly compares the
Greek σαλεύομαι, the metaphor
being taken from the tossing
of a ship in a wild sea.

687. I do not consider the
antithesis between the two pro-
nouns me and te a sufficient

690. concubinatus denotes a
kind of ‘morganatic' marriage

discredit upon the wife, but ex-
pressed her social inferiority to

toi-y of Roman Law ξ, 533.
