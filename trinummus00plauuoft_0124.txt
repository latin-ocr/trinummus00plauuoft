801. queant, sc. uxores. (The plural is an aesthetical cor-
rection by Meier of the ms. reading queat, which would be
personui and rude.) Sp. retains queat. 802. The mS. reading
may be explained by assuming the use of two synonyms em-
phatically express-ing one and the sanie idea: see n. on v. 130;
but as even then we are obliged to add te (which is not in the
mss), Seyffert may perhaps be right in consider-ing the words et
te moves as a gloss which superseded the original reading ted
ocius. Sp. reads m hinc amoves et te admoves. Ι confess not
to understand his admones. 803. Instead of aperi, abi seems
to me to be far preferable. 804. The mss. read continuo
operito ,· but the present imperative is clearly required by the
analogy of the two preceding lines, and such a pronunciation as
continuo operito is quite unexampled in Plautus. Ι have eon-

being the fiftieth part of the
value in most instances, they
were called πεντηκοστολόγοι at
Athens. They were also permit-

χ 796. segnities ‘slowness'; he

means ‘it is mere waste os

time'. .
797. quamvis belongs to lorzgyi

‘ talk of ever such great length':
cf. n. on v. 380. For the phrase
texere sermones Brix compares
the Homeric expression μύθους
ὑφαίνειν (Γ 212).

800. eampse is not given by
the mss„ but required by the
metre. Plautus says both eumpse
and ipsum, eampse and ipsam.
See also Corssen 11 847.

803. The money to be taken
from the hoard is not intended
for the sycophant‚ but to be
kept in readiness for the dowry
after the delivery of the letters
supposed to be brought by him
from Charmides.
