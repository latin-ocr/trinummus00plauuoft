38 TRINVMMVS. [II. 1. 3—9.

scd hoc non liquet nec satis cogitatumstss
utram potius hairum mihi §.rtem expetessam‚
utram aetati agundae arbitrer firmiorem:
⁶230 amorin med {tn re opsequi potius pair sit: 5
[utra in parte plus sit voluptatis vitae
ad aetatem agundam]
de hac re mihi satis hau liquet: nisi hoc sic faciam,
opinor, ”w
ut utre'tmque rem simul exputem‚ iudex sim reusque
ad ea‘tm rem.

230. amo‘rz'n me an re'i R. who considers the dative rei to be a
spondee. But this is shown to be contrary to Plautine usage by
Ο. Seyffert, ‘ Studia Plaut.’ p. 25 sq., whom Ι have followed in the
text. 231, 2. are J'ustly considered spurious by Fleckeisen: inthe “
first place, nearly the same words are read Amph. 633, sacinparva
res est voluptatum in vita atque in aeta-te ayundcw but even
greater weight should be attributed to the awkward repetition of
the phrase ad aetatem agundam as compared with v. 229, and to
the fact that voluptas is here quite out of place: as Lysiteles is
perfectly aware that the voluptas is all on the side of love, and

arandis labos connected with an orderly lise, cf. v. 270 sq. In spite
of these arguments Sp. does not bracket these lines.

Introd. to the Aul. p. xvh—-
magister exercitor (an expres-
sion like mulier meretrix and
in Greek ἀνὴρ στρατιώτης) is
the παιδοτρίβης, below merely
exercitor v. 1016. As a master
lays tasks upon a boy, so his
mind wearies him with care
and thought.

227. sed ho‘c ozon liquet=sed
hoc estquod mihi non liquet,
quod nondum ad liquidum
potui perducere.

228. artem = rationem vitae,
cf. Hor. od. 111 3, 9 hac arte
Pollux et vagus Hercules Eni-
szts arces attigit iyneas. (Lin-
dem.)

229. aetati aqundae ‘ for the
conduct of life’.

230. rei obsequi is said by
zeugma in the sense of rei
studere ‘ to follow lucrative pur-
suits'.

233. hau is a Plautine form
admissible before consonants
only-satis hau is a somewhat
unusual order instead of hau
satis, but precisely this devia-
tion from the common phrase
renders it more emphatic ; Brix
compares Aul. 229, tu me bos
mayis hau respicias.—1n order
to understand nisi, it is neces-
sary to supply a sentence like
‚zssssswffgtusffaessgzs

prouches the sense of sed.

234. reus he may be called

as he will have to submit to
