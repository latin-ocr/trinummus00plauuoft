88 TRINVMMVS. [III. 1. 13-22.

ibo ad meum castigatorem atque ab eo consilium
petam.

615 ST. propemodum, quid illic festinet, sentio et subolet
mihi:

ut agro evortat Lesbonicum, quando evortit aedi-

bus 15

6 ere Charmides, quom apsenti hic tfia res distra-
hitur tibi,

utinam te rediisse salvom videam, ut inimicos tuos

ulciscare et mihi, ut erga te fui et sum, referas

gratiam.
620 nimium difficilest reperire amicum ita ut nomen
cluet,
quoi tuam quom rem credideris, sine omni cura
dormias. 20
se'd generum nostrum ire eccillum video cum adfini

suo.
nescio quid non satis inter eos convenit: celeri gradu

mss3 ad me pertinere Sp„ but surely it is much sounder criticism
to adopt med. 617. Charmide Sp. with the mss. 622. ecillzcm
Sp. with the mss„ but such forms I should once for all exclude
from the text of a school-edition.

614. σαεεῐῃαῖονσυι, Megaro-
uides. It should be observecl
that in early Latin the vei-bal
nouns in tor (sor) do not al-
ways bear the sense of being
a habitual or perpetual agent,
but are often used of a per-
son who has only once exe-
cuted the idea of the verb.
Here e.g. castigator is not he
who always or habitually blames
Callicles, but who has done so
only once--qui nuper me casti-
gavit.

615. For subolet mihi ‘ I
have an inkling of it', (ef. be-
low 698,) see n. on Aul. 214.
But sentire also means ‘I smell',

comp. the French cela sent mal.

617. quom, though causal,
takes the indicative according
to the habit of archaic Latin.

619. The character of Stasi-
mus is very happily delineated:
in spite of his roguery he is
attached to his master, but even
in this attachment remains (le-
lightfully selfish. ut = quod talis,
as in Greek ὠς might stand in-
stead of ὅτι οὕτως, οἶοςῐότι τοι·
οὗτος.

620. ita ut nomen cluet ‘in
the true sense of the word ',
cf. v. 496.

621. For sine &nini see n. on
v. 338 and Introd. Aul. p. xmn.
