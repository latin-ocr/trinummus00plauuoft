33 is placed before 32 by Sp. ; but without satisfactory grounds.

35. The mss. read quod prosint, which was in the old editions
changed to quod prosit, and eonsidering how frequently an η
creeps in -where it is by no means wanted, it should be confessed
that this correction was very easy, though it may also be owned
that Ritschl’s former emendation quo prosint has greater proba-
bility. This he has, however, recently cancelled by keeping quod
and accounting for it as an old ablative sing, a form which he
reproduces below, v. 807. But it may be justly doubted whether
Plautus would use an abl. quod without being obliged to do so on
metrical grounds. C. F. W. Miiller ‘Nachtriige' p. 31 defends the

reading of the mss. by reminding us of the expressions id, illud,
m'hiz prosum and noceo: but it may be doubted whether this be

applicable here. Sp. follows R.

fied in seeing in this an allu-
sion to the dearth which seems
to have prevailed at Rome at
the time of the first performanoe
of the Triuummus; see below
v, 484.

34 sq. We have here another
allusion to the circumstances of
the time in which the play was
first brought out. Both here and
below, v. 1033, the poet com-
plains of the increase of ambitus5
the pauciores (οἱ ὀλίγοι) being of
course the aristocratia party.
(See Ritschl, Par. p. 350.)

35. pars hominum fuciunt, a
common construction κατσὶ σύν-
εσιν, the subject express-ing plu-
rality. See the instances given
by Drfiger 1 147 sq„ and comp.
e. g. Most. 114 maana pars
morem hunc induxerunt. Truc.
1 2, 12 pars spectatormn scitis,-
both constructione are blended
Capt. 229 nam fere maxuma
hunc pars morem homines habent,
where maxuma pars homines=

plerique homines.

36, gratiae perhaps properly
‘the various exertions 01 their
infiuence’: but it should be ob—
servcd that Plautus is fond of
using the phu-al of abstract
nouns where the singular would
be the rule in the classica] period.
Conip. e. g. opulentiae below
490, veteres parsimoniae 1028,
and other instances collected by
Lorenz on Most. 345, and see in
general the list given by Dr'ager
1 9. The plural use of ab·
straet nouns is subsequently
one of the principal features ot
later Latin, and above all of the
African style: see Bernhardy,
grundriss der r‘om. lit. (lth ed),
p. 324.

37. odiossus is a genuine spell-
ing here preserved by the pa-
limpsest and warranted by the
recurring spellings Inrnmossvs
and Vnmzvcossvs in the fasti
Capitolini (Bitschl Opusc. 11

715). The original form of this
