72. After this line the mss. add the following three lines:

Sin immutare vis ingenium moribus,
Aut si demutant mores ingenium tuum,
Neque eos antiquos servas, ast captas novos

which were justly rejected by Ritschl. It will be understood at
once that the first and second cannot exist side by side on account
of the awkward repetition of the verb mutare, and the first is
indeed omitted in the palimpsest: in the second it would be neces-
sary to explain ‘or if the bad morals of the period deprave your
natural disposition '—-but is this not saying the same as ‹zearotant
artes antiquae tuae? In the third line, ast is contrary to the
habit of Plautus, who has at in numerous places, but ast only
Capt. 111 5, 25 (where Brix, however, reads at), and Mero. 216,
and most likely we should write at there also. We may also add
that eos seems to us extremely languidi, and that the phrase cap-
tare mores noros would be unparalleled in Plautus. (Sp. cancels
only the first line, but maintains the other two. Ι consider this
as very perverse.)
