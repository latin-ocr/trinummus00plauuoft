xii PREFAcE.

passages of the second edition of his great work, and there
is a set of Plautine critics—Studemund‚ Spengel, Ο,
Seyffert, A. Lorenz—who follow the same principle with
myscls : to respect Ritschl⁷s authority as much as possible,
but not blindly to accept as an oracle whatever new
doctrine he preaches. To write the history of Ritschl’s
criticism on Plautus would be an interesting task, but it
would be premature to do so before the concluding volumes
of his New ‘Eoecursuses and before the termination of his
second edition of Plautus.

The success of the present edition of the Trinummus
has given me courage to publish a few more comedies
with English notes. The next play will be the Budens,
in which Ι hope to do more for the text, as Ritschl and
other scholars have not yet edited that play.

I hope that the favour shown to the first edition of
the Trinummus will also be extended to the second issue,
and to the companion volumes which will be published
in due time.
