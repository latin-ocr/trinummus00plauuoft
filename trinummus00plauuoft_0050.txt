34 TRINVMMVS. [Ι. 2. 162—169.

nihil est profecto stultius neque stolidius

200 [neque mendaciloquom neque adeo argutum magis]
neque ccssnfidentsscSquius neque peiiurius,
quam urbani adsidui cives quos scurras vocant. 165
atque egomet me adeo cum mis una ibidem traho:
qui illorum verbis falsis acceptor fui,

205 qui omnia se simulant scire neque quicquam sciunt.
quod quisque in animo aut habet aut habiturust,

sciunt:

200. The mss, read mendaciloquius at variance with the
scanning of the line, nor is it possible to find a reason why Plautus
should first have used a comparative and afterwards vnayis argutum
instead of arantum, which would have rendered the line much
smoother. (See also Neue, Formenl. 11 p. 112, g 61 fin.) aryutus,
inoreover, does not appear to have such a pronounced bad sense
as the other adjectives of this line and the next ‹Ramsay on Most.
p. 93). Bitschl seems, therefore, right in considering this line as
an interpolation or rather as a dittography of the next.

206-209. ‘Tot a sententiarum nexu et ratione incommodis
laborant, ut minime culpandus videatur qui hos versus universos
a Plauto abiudicet‚ quamquam eos saltem, qui sunt 206—208, ex
ipsa nisi fallimur antiquitate repetendos? erscm„ Ι should think
that it will be difficule to prove the impossibility that Plautus was

199. stultu-s· and stolidus are
identical in derivation and al-
most synonymous in meaning.
This would, therefore, seem to
be another instance of the use of
synonyms expressing one and
the same idea very forcibly.

201. confidens in the comio
poets generally bears a bad
meaning ‘impudent ⁷: n. on Ter.
Andr. 855. Phorm. 123.-—pe1'-
'iterius is the spelling given by
the palimpsest, and which ap-
pears in several othei· passages
in Plautus, who has the forins
periuraspez'iurus peiurus perier-
‹zre (Priscian has point-are) and
peierare: see Corssen 11 203.
1 648. Neue 11 p. 733.

202. The urbani adsidui· cives

are a class of ‘flaneurs' (Germ.
‘pflastertreter') who devote
their time merely to gossiping,
ἀδολέσχαι. So Most. 15, urba·
nus scarum cf. also Epid. 1 1,
13 and Truo. 11 6, 10. In Ho-
race a sem-ra is the same as
parasitus in Plautus: but comp.
also Cic. pro Quinctio vm. 11
parum facetus scurra..

203. ibidem is the habitna]
quantity of this word in Plautus,
not &Idem—The same phrase
and the same quantity recur
below, v. 412. It means ‘to
put to the same account, on the
same level ‘.

204. acceptorem essaalicuirei
seems a colloquial plu-ase, ‘to
listen to something'.
