fica—The sycophant considers
the whole affair as a good joke
in which he may exaggerate as
much as possible.

856. For ηοῃαε see n. on v.
396.— The sense is ‘my em-
ployer wffl then be the gainer,
in as far as Ι give him even
more humbug than he originally
stipulated for'. de rme means
⁴ concerning me', τούμὸν μέρος;
conciliare is ‘to prociue, buy’.

857. amentum hoc facit
‘money7 effects such a thing as
this'. The sycophant makes
the shallow and trite observa-
tion that for money you may
have anything —even such a
peculial· cos-‘cume as he is dress-
ed in. (Brix takes hoc for the
nom. and comp. Persa 1v 4,
100 divitias tu ea: 'istac-facies—
clearly against the sense of the
passage, 11111033 Ι am greatly
mistaken.)

858. chorszfflts (χορηγός) in
Plautus means merely a ‘garde-
robier’, i. e. lender of costumes
for theatrica] or other purposeS.
Of him the aediles hired the
costumes required for the per-

formance of their plays: cf.

Tox. ‹ibs choraqo samito. Dare
debet: praebenda aediles locci-
ve'rnnt. In the Curculio 1v 1 a
chorayus appears even on the
stage and expresses his {ears as
to the safety of his ornamenta
which he has given for the dress-
ing up of a nuyator lepidus:
ornamenta quae locavi metuo
ut possim recipere. The comi-
cum chor-afflant (χορηγεῖονε see
on v. 112) is mentioned Capt.
prol. 68.—suo periculo ‘at his
risk'.

859. circumducere ‘ to cheat'
is a frequent expression in Plau-
tus: below 959; Bacch. 311,
1183; Pseud. 529; Truc. Π 4,
21; Asin. 1 1, 83.

860. ipsum ⁴ by myself ’, with-
out requiring his instruction
(354). He means that Callicles
shall find out to his eost that
the sycophant is too elever for
him.

861. Ritschl has justly kept
