263. This line has been justly considered spurious by
Bothe and the succeeding editors (except SpengeD: it being im-
possible to construe it with the preceding line; though it might
perhaps be possible to transpose it after 261, in which case we
should also have to arrange it in this wav neque etim sibi voliint
α111ἱειιιιιάῐοἰ, 264. The mss read procul adhela udus which Bitschl
changes to abzhndus, Acidalius to abhibendus (a word not found
elsewhere). Hare and Bergk to abiyenclzts. But as we have already
noticed so many απαξ λεγόμενα 111 this play, and aS‚ moreover,
abstandus is again quite isolated in the Latinity known to us,
it will scarcely be too bold to accept Acidalius’ emendation, which,

at all events, has the advantage of closely approaching the read-
ing of the mss.—abstandus is the reading of the palimpsest, the

other mss, having a gloss aptinendus (i.e. abst.).·

annoyances consequent upon
imprudent connexions of the
kind previously described put
love to fiight and disgust a
lover with himself.

of obstare see crit. note.

265. The intransitive use of
praecipitare with a reflective
meaning occurs in Cicero and
Caesar, and becomes especial-
ly frequent in Livy and later
writers—quasi is in more than
one place found after compara-
tives: see n. on Aul. 229. It
is merely a compression of an
original quam si, the middle
stage qnamsei being supplied
by the lex agraria, 1. 27. <Bu-
cheler, lat. decl. p. 30.) Miiller
observes (Plaut. Pros. p. 107)

that quasi stands for quam si
only after comparatives in a
negative sentence3 the nega-
tion being in the present in-
stance implied in peius. The
construction saxo salire may be
defended by v. 639, officio mi-
grare. A Roman would natu-
rally think of the Tarpeian rock
from which criminals were fre-
quently precipitated.

added to imperatives even with-

this kind) valeas, tibi habeas
