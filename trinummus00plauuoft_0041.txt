v. 125 dedi, and a sign of exclamation would perhaps be more
appropriate than a note of interrogation. This may be another
reason why v. 126 should be considered as the addition of some
interpolator. 130. This is one of the most cui-ious passages 111
Ritschl’s criticism. The mss. read secutus est (secus est FZ) aut quid
interest: in his second edition Ritschl gives quid seetlust [aut quid
interest] while his ‘proecdosis’ boldly substituted quid sectiust
nam, te obsecro, a change now merely mentioned in the notes. It
is strange that Bitschl should adhere to his first opinion iu spite
of Brix's elaborate note, in which tautologies of this kind are
shown to be peculiar to colloquial language: see also Lorenz on
Mil. gl. 451, aeque vos qui sitis homines novi mque scio. But
undoubtedly Ritschl’s note in the second edition may easily
mislead 1115 readers ‘sectius-1⁴. R Proleg. p. Lxxv auctore Varrone
apud Gellium xvnI 9³: on consulting Gellius, we find that in
treating of sequ· in the meaning ‘to speak' (Ξὲπ- 111 Greek, cf.
ἔννεπε ἕσπετε) he also refers to a Plautine line, Men. 1047, Which
as he says Varro read wihilo minus esse ridetur sectius quam so'nmz'a
and explained ‘nihilo magis narranda esse quamsi ea essent
somnia,' i. e. he derived sectius from the root sec-‚ though it
should be added that this is absolutely nonsense in the passage in
question ; but those acquainted with Varro’s precious etymolog-ies
will neither wonder at it nor find it out of keeping with his
character. But while in his first edition Ritschl assures us ‘sectius
h.e. teste Gellio xv111 9 secins’ (of which Gellius says nothing), he
even goes so far in his second as to quote Varro in support of a
reading which in that sense Varro certainly did not defend. But
to cut a long tale short, sectius (which Ritschl reads here and
Men. 1047, and Ribbeck has instead of rectius in a line of Titinius,
v. 74, Com. p. 123) is a form destitute of all authority, as has
been 5111110101111)ν shown by Oorssen, Krit. Beitr. p. 5-11. without
paying the slightest attention to Corssen, Ribbeck goes so far as to
propose secitiust in the present passage3 see his Coroll. in the sec.
cd. of his Conufraym„ p. Lv111.
