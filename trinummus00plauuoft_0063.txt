novi ego hoc saeculum, moribus quibus sit:
malus bonum malurn esse volt, {it sit sui similis:
turbant, miscent mores mali, raan, avarus, invidus:
sacrum profanum, publicum privatum habent, hiulca
gens.
haec ego doleo, haec sunt quae excruciant, haec
dies noctes canto ut caveas. ιο
quod manu nequeunt tangere tantum fas habent
quo manus apstineant:

287. The mss. read quae me (A) or que (ΒΘΗ), and it has been
justly observed by L. Spengel (though his son A. Sp. does not
appear to be of the same opinion) that the pathetic turn of ex-
pression haec sunt quae is foreign to the habit of the Latin lan-
guage. His own idea, however, of throwing out sunt quae altogether
and admitting hiatus in the caesura, appears to me somewhat
violent: Ι would propose haec curae excruciant. One of the
archaia spellings of cura would be coira or coera (Corssen 1 356 sq.)
and from eoerae we might get by a mistake quaeum,- stent being
added as a gloss. haec is the usual nom. plur. of the feminine in
archaic Latin.

283. hoc saeculum ‘the pre-
sent generation'. <This is the

original sense of saeculum, a
word derived from the root sa,
in se-r-0‚ sci-tum, so that its
first meaning would be ‘seed'.)
285 sq. The allusion might
be as well to Greek as to Roman
life. Complaints of this kind
are so sweeping and general
that, especially in the mouth of
an old man, they will easily
apply to almost any period.

‘Fragm. and Speciniens of

in saying that mam} is ‘ perhaps

being exceedingly doubtful, as
the shortening appears to be
