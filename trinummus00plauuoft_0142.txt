933. Sp. omits with FZ the preposition ad. 934. The ms.B gives
here aridiculous misspelling (as th ere are ever so many more in that
ms‚): illa cubitus, and though CD and the other mss. give ubi, and
in spite of the unusual shortening of illa after a preceding long Syl-
lable, Ritschl puts an old sorm cubi (the existence of which in the
time of Plautus cannot be proved, but is merely infer-red strom this
passage) in his text. This is, however, justly rejected by C. F. W.
Mulier, ‘Nachtrii'ge’ p. 29. (Sp.'s text agrees with my own.)
