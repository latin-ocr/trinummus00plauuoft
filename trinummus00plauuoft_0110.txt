[111. 2. 38-45,

scio te sponte no'n tuapte errasse, sed amorem tibi 40

670 minus placet quod Consuadetur: quod dissuadetur,

quom inopiast‚ cupias: quando eius copiast, tum

non velis.

670. Ι follow Ritschl in writing consumetur (see 672), and
omitting mafflis which in the palimpsest is placed after suadetur

and in the other mss, before quod.

(Sp. placet magis quod sua-

detur.) This reading emphasizes the conti-ast between cons-undere
and. dissuadere and is also confirmed by v. 672, which is no doubt

a mere imitation of this line.

664. For in 6cculto see Introd.
to Aul. p. ξων. Plautus himself
wrote oculto with only one c.—
We should join maxume with
voles, comp. Most. 1093, id maz-
ume volo.

665. We should pronounce
tv’izzyerzu—. Λιήῃσηιίιιη ἰἠῃειιιιοηι
is a pleasing paronomasia.

667. pectus might in Greek
be translated by φρένες. teneo
‘ 1 understand': cf. the ‘ canti-
cum' at the beginning of the
second Act—viae amoris, like
‘all the ways of Love ², his trioks
and cunning sleights

668. ballista does not mean
the machine, but the bal] or
stone or whatever else is thrown
by it. See also Poen. 1 1, 73
where the machine itself is
called ballistarium.

669. The adjective morus

(εμωρός) is confined to Plau-
tus: cf. especially Men. 571,
maxume more ‘moro molestoque
multum.

670. minus placet is merely
a variation of the simple dis-

plicet.

671. There is an alliteration
and (in spite of the difference
in quantity) even a certain as-
sonance between cupias and
copiast. Observe, moreover,
the antithesis between in-‹ina
and eopia (=‹:o-opia). Brix is
perhaps right in assuming the
loss of tum (which in a ms,
might be merely τῖι or τῦ and
could easily be passed by after
t of the preceding word) before
cupias.- but it would not be
necessary to omit eius, which
should in that case merely be
pronounced as a monosyllable.
