TRINVMMVS.

[11. 2. 70-77.

‘quo'd habes, ne habeas, et illud quod non habes,

habeas, malum z

70

queindo equidem neo tibi bene esse pote pati ne-

que alteri ’.

PH. scio equidem istuc ita solere fieri: verum, gnzite

mi,

is est inmoenis, quoi nil est qui moenus fungatur

suom.
Γ LV. deum virtute habemus et qui nosmet utamur,
pater,
et aliis qui comitati simus benevolentibus 75

ΡΗ. non edepol tibi pernegare possum quidquam

quod velis.

quoi ta egestatem tolerare vis 2 loquere audacter patri.

352. pote is the reading of the palimpsest, superseded in the
other 11155. by the gloss φθίσω cf. Persa 30, si tute tibi bene esse

pote (5ο OD, potes ΓΖ) pati..

358. The mss. read cuius from which

Ritschl in his first edition elicited σαί ιιι or, in Plautine spelling,

351. malum I take to be thc
vocative = homo nihili, nequam,
as Plautus frequently has it;
it might be objected that Ly-
siteles would not use such a
strong expression towards his
father; but it may be observed
that these words are not directly
addressed to Philto, but merely
convey a hint which he may con-
strue according to his pleasure.
——quod habes means his riohes,
which the miser is to lose;
quod non habes is paupertas,

352. equidem with other per-
sons except the third was origi-
nally rejected in Plautus and
Terence by Ritschl (Proll. p.
76 sqq.), but Ribbeck's explana-
tion οἰ it, according to which
it is not a compression of <²90
quidem, but composed of the
interjection c and quidem (Lat.
Part. p. 41), is now approved

by Ritsclil and Corssen 11 856.
The instances of equidem eqo
collected in my note on Ter.
Haut. 632 should not, therefore,
be considered pleonasms any
longer.

354. Ι have not hesitated to
restore the old spelling of the
word, both in the adjective and
in the substantive, though
Ritschl does not give it in his
text. Even Lucretius uses the
antique form moenera in three
places: Munro on 1 29.-F01·
the constr. of sanyr· 555 n. on
v. 1.

356. The phrase comitati
esse (zcomem esse) alic-ui seems
to occur only here—For bene-
volens see v. 46.

357. perneyare = persistere
in negando: cf. Asin. 11 2, 56
pernefflcbo atquc obdurabo, per-
iurabo denique.
