1111101, amices mihi ne' fuas:

gl6riam et gratiam: h6c probis pretiumst.
eo 1111111 magis lubet cum probis p6tius
quam inprobis viv ere vanidicis.

267. Most mss. add umquam at the end of the line, but this
word is omitted in the palimpsest. 268. misere has been added
by Hermann and Bitschl.

271. The palimpsest has labos arandis capitur, to which the
other mss. add the gloss animo before labos. Ι follow Bitschl.

amabo, item nos perhiberi <with which Ritschl defends it Pron.
p. cen) differs in the important point of the hiatus being in the
