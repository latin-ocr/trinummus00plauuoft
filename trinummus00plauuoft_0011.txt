ever, have written illis or illisce, as Muller thinks : Brix
adds hodie after cenamus, which is certainly quite 'm the
style of Plautus. But in my humble opinion, the very
possibility of three or more metrical corrections, among
which it is impossible to choose, destroys their proba-
bility and confirms the reading of the mss.

though the instances given by him should not be taken
on trust, as they are partly corrupt and partly belong to
different kinds of hiatus.

“But to return to the passage in our play, in which
we maintain that this hiatus should be acknowledged‚
