235. Sp. arranges the rest of this lyrical monologue in short
anapaestic lines, with the exception of v. 253-256, 111 which his
edition and mine are in agreement. I neither appi-ove of his
arrangement, nor do Ithink his anapaests very pleasing and elegant.
236. arteis is the spelling of the palimpsest‚ all the other mss.
giving artis. In cases of this kind, it will be prudent to follow our
best authorities instead of regulating the spellings in consormity
with fixed rules, as it is impossible to say whether the author
himself was consistent in details of this kind. See Munro's obser-
vations in the second edition of his Lucretius, p. 3S.—R-itschl
justly dislikes the inelegant pronunciation quem acl mo‘dztm: Ι
incline to think him right in considering quemadmodum a gloss for
qui, so that the line would end qui sese etpediant. 237. Here
Sp. would do well to recollect the first poem in Horace: seu
rupit teretes Marsus aper plagas. He surprises us with this ana—
paestic line: postalat se in plagas co‘nicere! 238. The mss.
add the gloss blanditur after subdole,· ef. the following line.
I consess not to understand the Latin Sp. produces here by

the mode of lise prescribed in
the iudicium.

236. se expediant seems to
occur only here, but has no
doubt the same sense as the
simple empediant: comp. below
v. 276, sepenetrare. res expedit
means ‘the affair takes a (cer-
tain) course’: Amph. 1 3, 23
nequiter paene expedivit prima
parasitatio ‘my first appear-
anco in the part of parasite
had nearly been a sad failure';
ib. prol. 5, ut res vostrorum om-
nium bene expedire voltis ‘as
you all wish your affairs to turn
out well ².

237. postulat is the Latin

for ἀξιοῖ, ‘claims‚ pretends',
and in many passages of the
comio writers is almost equiva-
lent to a simple velle. See n.
on Aul. 359. It takes not only
the infinitive, but also an ac-
cus. c. infin.: cf. Stich. 488,
Gapt. 739, and comp. the same
construction with volo though
the subj. is the same, below
v. 324—Love is here compared
to a hunter who spreads his
nets for catching the game.
238. eos is somewhat loosely
used as if a plural had preceded,
but plurality is implied in the
indefinite pronoun quemquam.
consulit ab re occurs only here,
