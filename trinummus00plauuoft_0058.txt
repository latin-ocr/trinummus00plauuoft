by BCD, while A has vestispica: he adds, however, ‘duplicem
ex ipsa antiquitate traditam esse scripturam apparet‚’ Nonius
also reading vestispici. 257 a. The reading of this line is
exceedingly difficult to settle: the palimpsest has haec 690
quum cum animo meo reputo, which might be taken as an
anapaestic tetrameter, but 1 quite agree with Ritschl ‘alienis-
