the author of 206, 7, 8, but am convinced that v. 209 is an inter-
polation. Sp. has all these three lines in the text.

206. Ι have now followed R.'s first ed. in inserting aut before
habet, instead of assuming the second syllable of habet to appear
here in its original long quantity. R. brings in one of his pet—
forms, animod, and Sp. writes in. animo habent aut habituri, which
appears to be very improbable. O. Brugman, ‘de sen.'p. 9, agrees
with my present view. 207. is perhaps an interpolation: both
the preceding and the succeeding line have the indicative in the
dependent sentence, and only here we have the interrogative
pronoun and the subj.

209. The line is given in the above shape on the authority of
the palimpsest: the other mss. have quae neque sutura neque facta
sunt against the metre. Bitschl justly says ‘confictus est ad ex-
emplum versus 206’. 212. The nominative omnis mortalis·
has the authority of BCD, while A is in favour of the ending
es. See above v. 29.

214. The palimpsest alone has omnibus against metre and
sense: cf. v. 194. (We might conjecture bonisque h. α. evm-tissa
omnibu& )

210. quem velint (= quemvis)
is the object of the two verbs
laudent and culpent, which will
be best understood by putting
sive between them.

211. mm flocci faciunt is a
common expression, comp. the

208. A phrase like the present
seems to have been proverbial.
Theocritus (xv 64) says of talk-
ative and meddling women πάντα

tials of Zeus and Here were a

secret to the gods themselves.
Of a scurra of modern times,
Butler says (Hudibras 1 1, 17
sqq.) ‘He could tell . . . What
Adam dreamt of, when his
bride Came from her closet in
his side: Whether the Devil
tempted her By a High-Dutch
interpreter' etc.

English ‘I do not care a straw’,
‘ a fig', etc.

213. ac sese is said emphati-
cally instead of ‘his name, his
family'.

214. suis is emphatic, ‘those
possessions which are his by
right'.
