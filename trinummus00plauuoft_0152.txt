1016. hunc hominem the mss. maintained by Sp. 1018. me-
moriam O. Seyffert, Stud. Plaut. p. 26; memoriae the mss. and
editions. The hiatus after oblitum seems admissible on account
of the punctuation; in orer to avoid it, Bitschl inserted tu
after quia in his first edition, aud now reads homenibus (for
which form see Introd. to Aul. p. Lxr and Bergk’s arguments
Philol. xvn p. 54 sqq„ and in the Jahrb. 1861, p. 633). Bergk
(Beitr. zur lat. Gramm. 1 98) proposes frzzffl's, a form attested by
Marius Victorinus, but completely foreign to Plautus. It would
also be possible to add tam after eum ; but these many possibili ties
merely annul the probability of these conjectures and seem to
plcad in favour ot· the hiatus. (To add an opinion of my own:
1 now think it extremely probable that we should read on αη vero
without hiatus; the missing syllable might then be gained by
adding ita after quial, i. e. repeating ia with the addition of a t.
But Ι have left the note of my first edition unaltered, to stand as
a protest against those dogmatic changes which abound in Plautine
criticism.) 1020 was placed here by R.; the mss. place it after 1022,
and there Sp. has it. 1021. Truthus B, truchus C, Chiruchus R,
Trochus Sp. who says ‘ nolim fugitivum interpretari, sed servus

Stasimus is afraid his ring 1018. The infinitive te esse
might be refused. if he allowed oblitum should not be con-
some time to pass over before ceived as dependent upon pudet,
claiming it. but rather as an exclamation
