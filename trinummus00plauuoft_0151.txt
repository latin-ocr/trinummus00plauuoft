1015. re om. in the mss„ added by Camerarius.

funny expression denoting the
sound of the lash made oi ox-
hide clashing down on Stasi-
mus' back; see n. on bubula
censio Aul. 593, where 1 might
also have quoted Most. 852,
mate castiglabit eos bubulis eru-
υἱ 173. See also Ramsay's inter-
esting Excursus ‘on punish-
ments infiicted upon slaves ’,
pp. 251—263 of his ed. of the
Mostellaria. consutus κότταβος
is an expression used in refer-
ence to the tax-em from which
Stasimus is just coming and
where he has, no doubt, prac-
tised the ‘cottal›us⁷.-—Here‚
again, we have a threefold al-
literation of great effect.

1012. abesse ab eri quaestione
means ‘to be found wanting
(absent) when the master in-
quires ': cf. Cist. 11 3, 49 ne ἰη
quaestione mila· sit, siquid enm
velim. Pseud. 663, risle sis nc
in quaestione sis, (lucendo accer-
sam, milia—desistere takes the
infin. like desinet-m cf. Bacch.
1171; Rud. 682; Men. 245.
(E. XValder, Infin. bei Pl. p.
20.) Comp. the analogous use
of the infin. after abstinere
Mil. )gl. 186; Curc. 177 (ib.
p. 22 .

1013. For satin see n. on v.
925.„—thermipolium is the regu-
lar Plautine form of the Greek
θερμοπώλιον (Ritschl Opusc. 11

488), i. e. a low tavern where
a mixture of wine and hot
water was sold to the lower
classes, especially to slaves.

1014. thermopotare was, as
it seems, a mere slang word,
as it is neither Greek nor Latin
(in the latter it is potare, and
θερμοποτεῖν might be a Greek
word, bnt does not occur, though
there is θερμοπότης); this hy-
brid word is, moreover. used as
a transitive verb ⁶ to wash one's
throat with something hot ⁷.
„fluitur is always masc. in Plau-
tus: cf. n. 011 Aul. 302.

1015. petere instead of peti·
tum, but the comic writers often
use the infinitive in this inan·
ner, which by the way corre-
sponds to the original sense
of the infinitive. It has been
proved that the infin. in Latin
is in origin a dative expressing
direction towards something,
and thus an aim or purpose.
Plautus has the infin. after
ire Most. 663 Bacch. 354; abire
Bacch. 9003 venire Bacch. 631;
Pseud. 10543 Rud. 94; currere
Asin. 9103 circum cursare Rud.
‘223 sq.‚ after properare in nu-
merous instances (see above v.
983 and below v. 1044); and
after mittere Pseud. 642 ; Cure.
206 sq. See E. 1Valder, Der
Infinitiv bei Plautus (Berlin,
1874), p. 15 sq.—-re recenti.-
