i v PREFACE.

first part of his New Eum-susem on Plautus, in which—
and that is by far the most important feature of it—he
showed greater respect for the authority of the mss. and
withdrew many of the changes he had formerly made in
the text of the poet³. But the principal novelty of
Ritschl's essay was the wholesale introduction of an ab·
latival d into the metres of Plautus to avoid the annoy-
ance caused to Ritschl by the occurrence of hiatus. This
doctrine—which was, to say the least of it, highly sur-
prising in a scholar like Ritschl who had hitherto been
addicted to sweeping remedies, but had now suddenly
been converted to adopt a somewhat homoeopathic
panacea: a remedy, moreover‚ which was, if not as old
as the hills, still nearly as old as Plautine criticism itself,
but had been distinctly repudiated by him in his earlier
stages, excepting of course the ablatives med and ted——
this doctrine seems destined to play in Plautine criticisn'i
the part of the whilome apple of Eris. At least Ritschl’s
essay at once caused Th. Bergk to publish a rejoinder,
entitled: Auslautendes D im alten Latein,· ein Beitray
zur lateinisclcen Grcmnmatilc. HaHe, 1870. In spite of
the unnecessary acerbity of expression in which Bergk
indulges, he seems to have shown that Ritschl certainly
went too far in affixing his ablativa] d not only to nouns,
adjectives and pmnouns, but also to adver-bs, prepositions
and imperatives. In the same way, O. F. W. Mffller,
the author of a bulky volume on Plautine prosody written
in the spirit, but without the genius, of Ritschl’s chap-
ters on prosody in the Prolegomena to the Trinummus,
was roused by the contemptuous treatment he received
at Ritschl’s hands in the new edition of the Trinummus‚
to publish an elaborate collection of Addenda (Nachtrc'iye)
