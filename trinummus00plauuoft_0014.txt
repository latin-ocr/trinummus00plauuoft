X PREFACE.

going changes, Those who are, like myself, much en—
gaged in practica] teaching‚ will agree that it is very
unpleasant to have discordant editions of a text-book in
one and the sanie class, the second edition perhaps fiatly
contradicting the statements of the first. While I have
therefore added a considerable amount of grammatical
information which Ι thought calculated to increase the
usefulness of my work as a school-book, I have not
changed the text itself in many places, nor have I intro-
duced many alterations into that part of the commen-
tary which was contained 111 the first edition3 though
Ι have< now and then substituted another expression in

pupils happen to be of a critical turn of mind, and if the
pupils should be sufficiently advanced to appreciate critical

Ι discussions, I think that the sense of a passage will be

more fully elucidated and understood in all its niceties
by considering the various readings proposed for it than
by merely explaining one reading which is to some extent
taken on trust.

In revising my notes, I have once more gone over the
old commentaries of Lambinus, Taubmann, and Linde-
mann, and I may say that I have been repaid by finding
in them some good observations which had previously
escaped my notice. In the first edition I had made much
use of the excellent edition of Professor Brix, who has
himself utilised the labours of the preceding commen-
tators. Brix's edition has meanwhile been re-issued in
1873. The editor has become a convert to Ritschl's d
