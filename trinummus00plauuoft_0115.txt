LE. i

707 sq. are rejected by Lade-wig and Ritselfl, as it seems
justly. In the preceding line hic was used of Lesbonicus, and.
cannot now be used of Lysiteles with such a sudden transition.
(Sp. does not bracket these lines.)—mclioris is the reading of the

mss: see n. on v. 29.

703. autument.- see n. on v.

704. The construction is ne
ani-m. ind. mc commissurum ut
id patiarfieri.

705. ozon enim is the reading
of the mss. and of Cicero (le
orat. 11 10, 39 who quotes this
line, and if it be right, we should
understand enim as = ‘ enim-
vero’, a sense it frequently has
in the comio writers; it is,
however, possible that Plautus
wrote noenum (which Ritschl
has in his text) : see n. on Aul.
67.-πα’λιν ‘ da capo '.

706. facilc ‘cloubtless’.——tna
comoedia ‘your acting': the
line is a faithful translation
from the Greek, being only ap-
plicable to Greek customs; at
Rome the actors (except the
dominus 9rc9is) were slaves and
treated as such: see the end of

the Cistellaria: ornamenta (their
costmne) ponent. postidea loci
Qui deliquit (who has played
badly) valvulam& qui non deli-
quit bibet.

708. From Tac. Ann. 1 77 it
appears that fines were not used
as a punishment for bad acting
until a later time‚—an addi-
tional argument to prove the
spuriousness of these two lines.
We may pronounce both tzic‘rz‘s
and tueris (treating the u as a
v); Plautus uses both tueri and
zui.

709. ‘ What business have
you to interruptus or tointrude
yourself upon our consultation ἶ) ’
