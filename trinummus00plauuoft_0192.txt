FOR SOHOOLS ΛΝΒ PARoomAL LIBRARIES.

The populari‘cy which the ‘ Books for Youngr Readers' have attained is
a sufficient proof that teachers and pupils alike approve of the use of inter-
cstinff stories, with a simple plot*l in place of the dry combination of letters and
syllables, making no impression on the mind, of which elementary reading*-
books generally censist.

The Publishers have therefore thought it advisable to extend the application
of this principle to books adapted for more advanced readers.
