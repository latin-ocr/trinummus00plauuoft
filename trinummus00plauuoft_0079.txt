II. 4. 5—7.] TRINVMMVS. 63

ST. exessum, expotum, exfinctum, elutum in balineis. ῡ
piscator pistor apstulit, lanii coqui
holitores muropolae aucupes: confit cito.

406. The mss. agree in reading comessum, in which the double
s is a spelling frequently found in the best mss. of archaio
writers, no doubt clue to the assimilation of cl to s, the original
form being conred-sum. Ι have, however, followed Ritschl in
writing emessam, a form given (perhaps from this very line)
in three old glossaries‚ and by the introduction of which we get

four participles equally compounded with ex.

from Terence Haut. 633 Hec.

406. emunctam, elutum (for
which Plautus probably wrote
exolutum: ‘the main delight
and extravagance of the bath
commenced: theirslaves anoint-
ed the bathers from vials of
gold, alabaster, or of crystal,
containing the rarest unguents
gathered from all quarters of
the world. The number of these
smegmata used by the wealthy
would fill a modern volume—
especially if the volume were
printed by a fashionable pub-
lisher; A maracinum, Illegmlium„
NarcIum—omne qnod erit in.
πῆμ’ LORD Lmrorr, The Last
Days of Pompeii, B. 1, ch. 7.
emunctam:unguentis absump-
tum, and elutum should be ex-
plained in the same manner.—
balinea (not balineum) appears
to be the form exclusively used
by Plautus, in close correspond-
ence with the Greek βαλανεῖον
(see n. on v. 112): instances
of balinea and balineum from
Inscriptions are collected by
Corssen 11 256. (See also ib.
347.) Cf. also Ritschl, Opusc.
11 523.

407. pistor ‘ nomen erat eius
qui ruri far pingebat: according
to Varro ap. Non. p. 152; ‘a

miller'‚ the baking of bread
being one of the duties of the
cook (as it is in the country
even now). See crit. n. on
Aul. 397.
408. holitor ‘ thegreengrocer'2
holus and holitor should be
spelt with an h both on ety-
mological grounds (see Cors-
sen 1 100, 11 160) and in accord-
ance with the Inscriptions (ib.
104) and mss. (Ribb. Ind. Verg.
p. 421): see also n. on Ter.
Andr. 369. Varro, however,
knows and accounts for olus, de
l. l. v 108 (p. 43 M. ).—aucupes
‘ poulterer’ : but isit not strange
that the μυροπώλης should be
mentioned with the greengrocer
and poulterer? As Mr Nettle-
ship observes (Academy‚ 111 ⁶299»
⁴ it is possible that Plautus may
have had in his eye the oustom
of using unguenta as cil for
herbs (comp. the proverb τὸ
ἐπὶ τῇ φακῇ μυρον), which is
known to have existed among
persons of vulgar and extrava-
pant tastes.’—corfit ‘is got
through ‘‚ instead of conficitur.
The same form was formerly
read Ter. Ad. 946, but has there
yielded to quom fit in recent
editions. For this and similar
forms see Munro on Lucr. 11
