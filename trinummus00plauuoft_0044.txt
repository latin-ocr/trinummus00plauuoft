147. Sp. joins this line with the preceding one by reading
nobis et quaeso, giving all to Callicles: in so doing, he revives the
ms. reading, emended by R. It should be added that Sp. does not
believe in the gap assumed by R and myself. Just as in the
passage quoted in the exeg. commentary from the Most. 474,
Theopropides returns an answer to the second injunction (ne-
most: loquere nunciam), it is necessary here that Meg. should say
something in answer to v. 147: Bitschl has, therefore, justly
assumed the loss of a line in this place, as a specimen of which
he proposes noli vereri.- tutu suut hic omnia. 152. lzic has been
added by Ritschl who also introduced the Plautine form nummum
instead of the reading of the mss, nummorum. Plautus has

always nummum in the genitive, except here, below 848 (where see
our note) and Most. 357 according to the common reading which

is, however, ‘I was just looking

152. The nummus Philippcus
was so called from Philip Π.
king of Macedonia, the father
of Alexander the Great, who
struck great numbers of gold
coins, having obtained a large
supply of that metal from the
mines of Thrace. See Ramsay's
edition of the Mostellaria, p.

was about 15 shissings, a mina
