Stasime‚ tene me.

1087. The ms. reading eqo miserum meis periculis has been
splendidly emended by G. G'otz (Acta soe. phil. Lips. 11 461 sq.)‚
whose reading we give in our text. The reading of the old editors

was eqo miser summis periclis.

1086. ‘I thought all along
you would grieve on hearing it '.

1087. For mis comp. n. on
v. 822, where we have the same
form as dativa—herculei labores
and herculeae aerumnae were
proverbial expressions. It suf-
fices to quote Pl. Persa 2, super-
avit aerumnis suis aerumnas
omnis Herculi.

1090. Cf. v. 839.-—Our mss.
read hac aetate, but Nonius
(p. 192, 17) quotes this line in

Luor. 111 597 animo malefactum
cum perhibetur. Charmides
means to say that he is going
to faint, not to lose his breath.
To prevent him from fainting,
Stasimus offers to sprinkle him
with water, a usual way of
refreshing persons: cf. Bacch.
248, euas, aspersisti aquam,
and the same phrase Truc. 11
4, 15; see especially Amph. v
1, 6 animo molest, aquam velim.
—In his answer Stasimus sub-
stitutes animam for the sake of
the pun which was easily ad-
missible on account of the
ending almost disappearing by
elision.
