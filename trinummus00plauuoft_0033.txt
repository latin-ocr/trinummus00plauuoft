64. Ritschl arranges the six last lines in the following man-
ner: 59. 61. 63. 64. 62. 603 but it is difficult to bring cogent
reasons against the order given by the mss.

Pl. p. 338.

62. faxo: see v. 60. It is
here added parenthetically with-
out influencing the construction,
ηε (⁸ indeed, to be sure ') tu hercle
haud nescias (⁶)'ou would soon
be aware’) being the apodosis
of the conditional sentence si
commutaverimus. on which the
whole conversation turns—ize
za hercle is frequently found nt
the beginning of lines: see e. g.
Mil. glor. 571, Men. 256, As. 412.
In the same way we meet m'th
‘ne tn edepol and ne τιι ecastor:
Brix on Men. 256.

63. mala res-:malum : so
again Most. 61. 867, Pseud. 770.
It means ‘ punishment ¹. Pareus
quotes Liv. xxm 3 notissimum
quodque malum maxime tolera-
bile dicentes esse.

65. Callicles confirms his
friend’s experience according to
which ‘the evil we know is best ³,
and means that the wife one
is aecustomed to is perhaps the
best to h've with after all. He
says ‘just as one lives long
together, one jogs on comfort-
ably’.-proz·nsle ut ‘just as' :
so below 659 and Most. 96.

On proinde ut. (quam. ac) see
also Nipperdey's note on Tac.
A. 1v :20 extr. Bitschl says
justly ‘versus ad diuturnitatem
consuetudinis spectat': but it
should be added that the mss.
agree in reading ut ἂωισυῖυὶΐιιν,
(liu Tiviturwhich may, perhaps,
mean ‘just as one lives in har-
mony (with one's wife), one has
a chance of living lonz‘. The
reading of the text is due to an
emendation of Acidalius.

66. aufer ridicularia ‘give
over jesting': comp. Aul. 630
aufer cavillam, Persa 797 ‘iur-

67. Callicles interrupts his
fricnd's speech by saying quid
renis? We should not, there-
fore, place a sun stop alter
venio.

68. multum is an adverb: see n.
on Aul. 124.-—Plautus uses iuri-
