ecfugiet ex urbe, ubi erunt factae nuptiae:
ibit statim aliquo in maxumam malam crucem,

590. eo has been appropriately added by RitschJ. Sp. keeps
this line in its original place, after 578, but 111 the following
shape: LE. i m, istnc cura quod te iussi. ST. eqo iam hic ero.
594. The metre of the line is not very elegant, though Ritschl
justly says that eticim nunc should be considered as one word—-

or rather, nunc is enclitic, as it is in many passages.

596. After

this line Ritschl has justly assumed a gap, the transition from
Stasimus to the new subject of efl'ztyiet being too sudden even for
the carelessness of the conversational style: Plautus would at
least have added <ipse or ipsus, meaning the master. Sp. does

not believe in this gap.

598. statim is Brix's emendation of

the ms. reading istac. Sp. prefers reading ibo istac.

591. Brix has collected 111-
stances from Plautus in which
ut is omitted after suadere (v.
681, Asin. 111 3, 54), mandare,
acligyere, dicere, orare, and ro-
yare. —cli vostramfidem ‘admi-
rantis adverbium cum excla-
matione,’ Donatus on Ter. Andr.

592. Though we have got
through our money, yet we
have been luchy in getting such
a good husband for Lesbonieus'

· sister—if only we can manage

to keep the land.

number of passages;—‘ eas for-

Curtius, Stud. v p. 437, who
observes that these forms are
by no means of the same sense

Greek γένωμαι. Above V. 267,
we fuas should be translated
μή γένοιο. Curtius⁷ whole paper
⁴ de aoristi latini reliquiis' opens
up entirely new views, and
should be read by all who are
interested in Latin grammar.

595. actumst cle collo meo
‘then it is all over with my
neck’ which will in that case
have to carry the heavy weight
of the helmet—though it is
strange that the helmet should
not be mentioned 'm the next
line.
