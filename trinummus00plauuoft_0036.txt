TRIN VMMVS.

[1. 2. 45—50.

suspiciost in pectore alieno sita. 45
nam ni'mc ego si te sfirrupuisse ssispicer
Iovi coronam de capite ex Capitolio,

,- qui in columine astat sfimmo: si id non feceris,

atquo id tamen mihi lfibeat suspicarier:
qui tu id prohibere me potes ne si'ispiccr2 50

85.

qui is an evident emendation by Scaliger and A. Becker

(Ant. p. 40> instead of quod which is given by all the mss,3 it
being absurd to inform the Romans where the Capitol was situated,
and moreover astare being employed not of things, but only os

persons.

85, 86. Bitschl considers these two lines as interpolations,
praef. p. xxxn, saying ironieassy ‘nimirum dedita opera Romani
edocendi suerunt, quo in loco Capitolii sui statua illa Iovis con-

spiceretur ⁷.

I maintained them as genuine in my first ed„ and

am glad to find that Sp. does the same.

sion. Comp. also Plaut. Pseud.
608, condus promus sum, pro-
curator peni. Callicles means
that he can manage his thoughts
by himself without any foreign
advice. The dative pectori is a
‘dan commodi’, which we find
not rai-ely used by the 0011110
poets in a free and easy man—
ner: see below 204. Similarly
we have Bacch. (552 sq. habet
multipotens pectus, ubiqnomqne
usus sict, pectore promat sno.
For the sense of pectus see also
below V. 90.

83. For the archaic form
szcrrzzpere see my note on Aul.
39; to the quotationsthere given

may be added Fleckeisen, jahrb:

Lx, p. 252, and the materials
collected by Schuchardt 1 173
sq.

84. The expression was pro-
verbial to denote a great and
daring crime: comp. Men. 941
where Menaechmus, infuriated
by the (to 111111 inexplicable)
persistance 01 the old man, calls
out: at (⁷90 te sacram coronam

surrupuisse Iovis scio. On this

passage W. A. Becker, Ant.
Plaut. p. 30, says ‘Verumne sa-
crilegium respexerit Plautus an
audacissimum facinus signifi-
care voluerit, dubitari potest.
Lambinus quidem adnotavit fe-
cisse hoc Petilium quendam
eumque ex eo dictum esse Ca-
pitolinum7 quam fabulam nullo
1101111110 firmatam qui secuti sunt
editores commentariis suis in-
seruerunt. at vero Capitolinus
ille, neutiquam a sacrilegio no-
tatus, duobus paene saeculis post
furti accusatus est: vide Hor.
Sat. 1 4, 94 sqq. atque eius
Commentatorem Crucquianum.⁷

85. Plautus alludes to the
statue of Juppiter Triumpha-
tor in the highest part of the
Capitol, in which the god was
crowned with a laurel-wrea'th:
Becker 1. L—columen is a pecu-
liar Plautine form instead of
culmen.- he has it also meta-
phon'cany CaS. 111 2, 6 senati
columen.—Observe id here and
in the next two lines, where
the emphasis of the repetition
will be easily perceived.
