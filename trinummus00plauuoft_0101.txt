keeping large armies of μισθο-
φόροι was in vogue among the
numerous kings and princes who
had divided the great conquests
of Alexander between them-
selves, and who were continually
at war with one another. The
bragging officer (miles olor-iosus)
and the dissolute young man
who will not obey his father’s
commands (e. g. in Terence’s
Hauton timorumenos) are fi-
gures of these wars with which
the adaptations of the Roman
poets have rendered us familiar.

599. latrocinari is the usual
expression for μισθοφορεῖν in
Plautus: cf. latro μισθοφόρος,
Mil. gl. 74, 949, Stich. 135,

Poen. 111 3, 50, 53; and espe-
cially Bacch. 20, latronem suam
qui αιινο vitam venditet. Varro
del. 1. vn 52 Μ. derives these
expressions from λάτρον ‘mer-
ces'. According to Vanffiek,
Etym. Wo'rterb. p. 145, there
is a Latin root Iu, lav ‘ to gain,
win’, whence come lucrum,
Lat-ema (the goddess of thieves),
and latro.

600. qno, sc. ut irem.

601. hic, the present pos-
sessor.—The interval between
the second and third Aet was
no doubt filled up with music:

the first Aet), tibicen vos interea
