Most of the prologues to the
Plautine plays can be conclu-
sively shown to belong to the end
of the sixth century v. o. and
to be due to a time in which
the old. comedies were revived
on the Roman stage, the produc-
tive power of the living poets
having failed. The only three
prologues which seem to hold
an exceptional position are those
to the Aulularia, Rudens and
Trinummus3 but on the first,
sstffissffi ἰῖὲ ξὲἕὲῗῗξὲῗῖἐ ἓξὲξ
necessarily share the fate of the
others. The prologue to the
Rudens, is, if nothing more,
considerably interpolated; and
it is not very probable that the
above prologue should be ge-
nuine, the only exception among
its fellows. It is, however, made
withconsiderable skill, and espe-
cially the lines 18-—21 would,
if any reliance were to be placed
on this whole kind of compo-
sitions, prove it to have been
recited at the first persor-mance
of the play. (G. Dziatzko be-
lieves that the greater part of
this prologue, excepting v. 6 and
7, is genuine, but v. 18—21 he
holds to be an addition made

by some later scholar. See A.
Lorenz, Phil. xxxii 272.)

1. fungi is in Plautus fre-
quently joined with the accusa-
tive, while Terence has it so
always in the phrase sunni offi-
cium: see n. on Ad. 603. Cf.
below 354; Men. 223. In the
same way we often find un· with
the aec. (e. g. v. 827), and in
Terence also. frunisci malum
occurs Pl. Rud. 1v 3,· 73, and
frui with the acc. is read in
Apuleius3 fzmyi takes the same
case in Tacitus, Suetonius, Apu-
leius, and. even in Corn. Nepos
xiv 1, 4, who sayss. militare mu-
nus. See Dragen Synt. 1 p. 526
sq. v'esci takes the acc. in Accius,
Sallust, ancl Tac„ potiri has the
same construction in Plautus,
Terence, Tacitus, Apuleius, Gel-
lius. See Driiger, p. 528.

22 finem,i. e. of my Journey-‚of
this expeclition.——finemfore quem
dicam is a somewhat lengthy
expression instead of qui sit
finis. So Ruti. 611 sq„ nunc
quam ad rem dicam hoc attinere
somnium, Numquam hodie quivi
ad coniecturam evadere. See also
Ter. Phorm. 659 sq.
