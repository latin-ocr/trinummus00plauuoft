240. The lover is here called latebri-
cola in accordance with v. 261 sq.

It is not, therefore, ne-

cessary to write latebricola, homonum as Ritschl is inclined to
do. 242. The text gives the reading of the Ambrosian palim-
psest, while the other mss· have a manifest interpolation: savis
sagittatispereussus est. Comp. also Apul. Apol. p. 19, 1 (Kriiger)
Venus *nullis ad turpitudinem stimulis vel inlecebris sectatores
suos percellens (pelliciens Jahn). The litera] meaning of percellere

ie ‘to knock over'.

but in rem consulere would
clearly be ‘advisa to one’s
advantage’; ’ἰη rem stands in
this sense below v. 268. in¹ rem

241. There is a happy an-
tithesis between this line and
the preceding: though Cupid
is the seducer of those who
stray from the safe track of
publicity, he is at the same
time the betrayer of the hidden
joys of the lovers—celatum:
celatorum.

242. quom externplo, ἐπεὶ
τάχιστ-(ιε cf. V. 492, 725, and
many other places—saviis eins
quod amat=saviis amicae; in
this way quod amat is often
met with, e. g. Mero. 744, nam

qut amat (=amator)‚ quod amat
(zamicam‚ τὸ φιλούμενον) si
habet, id habet pro cibo. Cure.

243. ilico is the genuine
spelling, not illico—‘liquitur
pronuntiandum esse, non liqui-
tur, Biicheler monet‚' Ritsch1;
but the Augustan poets say
liquitur wherever they use the
word: Virg. G. 1 43, A. 111
27, 1x 8133 Lucan, 1x 772, and
so also Lucr. 11 1132: why
should it, then, be short in
Plautus? The only reasons
which may be alleged may be
found in Munro's note on Lucr.
11 4523 but Mr Wordsworth is
no doubt right in saying ‘the i
is regularly long in the depo-
nent, but short in the transitive
liquare) (Fr. {md Sp. of E. L.
