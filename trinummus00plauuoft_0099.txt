med is not warranted by the mss, a'nd the words quin tu should
not be thrown out: see the exeg. notes. My present reading
agrees with Sp. and differs from the mss. only in eom-enat instead

of conveniat.
I follow Ritschl.

583. quid opus sit sacto Sp. from Camerarius.
584. dari Sp. against the mss But the

lengthening of the final e in dare is quite justifiable here in the

metrical pause.

me off.

583. For the constr. opus
est facto see n. on Ter. Andr.

584. certumst.- see n. on 270,

quin, v. 495. In both quin has
its original sense ‘why not’. It

freedom.

329, 348 (probably also Pl.
Men. 143, 925) and is in the
mss. always spelt as one word3
but from the Virgilian passage,
Ecl. VIII 7 sq. en erit ‘umquam
Ille dies, it appears that we
should separate it into two
words, in accordance' with its
origin; as has always been
done in another passage of
virgil, Ecl. 1 67, en umquam
patrios lonyo post tempore fiuiS.
This was first pointed out by
Lambinus3 the whole subject
has been recently discussed by
O. Ribbeck, Lat. Part. p. 34.
