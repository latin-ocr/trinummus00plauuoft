PREFACE. v

to his first volume, in which he felicitously impugns
Ritschl's innovations in the point of final d, and of such
other supposed archaisms, as cubi, eunde and a nom. plur.
of the first declension in ag. But all these scholars were,
it may be supposed, more or ‘less prejudiced against
Ritschl's new doctrine from the very beginning, and
even the occasional violence of their expressions is little
calculated to produce a favourable impression upon im—
partial readers. The best refutation of Ritschl’s new
theories, and one which I confess to be quite satisfactory to
’ my mind, is found in the very calm ancl candid statement
given by Corssen in his new edition, Vol. Η. p. 1005—
1009. Corssen shows, by simple and incontrovertible
numerical statements‚ that in tlte conversational lanyuaye
of alae time qf' Plautus aad Ennius tlte final D of the
ablativa qs nouus laad quite dis-appeared, and that even as
early as the first Punic war the said d has disappeared in
many instances. Oorssen concludes—‘It is certain that
a frequent introduction of an ablatival d into the text
of Plautus does not represent a faithful image of the
pronunciation of ablatival formations in the Plautine
period, and that at present Latin Grammar should re-
cognise only those instances of an ablatival d, which rest
on the authority of the mss, or inscriptions.²

“ It should be added that the authority of the msS.
does not favour the introduction of a final d in Plautus,
except in the case of med, ted, and perhaps sed (ε se). In
the prepositions antid and postid the original forms seem
also to have maintained their ground somewhat longer
than others, but secl (‘without’) recl and prod appear only
in compounds.

“ Ooncerning adverbs, we have in the famous Senatus-
consultum de Bacanalibus the adverb facilumed, and to
this we owe the introduction of a number of similar forms
in Bitschl's new edition. But Oorssen justly opposes this
measure ΙΙ. p. 469 sq„ as Bitschl appears unable to allege
a single passage in which an adverb ending in <l is either
warranted by the mss. or necessitated by the metre—
except, perhaps, at v, 726 in the present play, where
placided would seem to avoid an inadmissible hiatus.
