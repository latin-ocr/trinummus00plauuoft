si hoe non credis ego credidero, CA. quid? ST. me

CA. quam dudum istuc aut ubi actumst? ST. ilico,

CA. tanton in re

610 quam in re salva Lesbonicus faetus est frugalior?

ST. atque equidem ipsus ultro venit Philto oratum

filio.

CA. flagitium quidem hercle fiet, nisi dos dabitur

Virgini.

postremo edepol ego istam rem ad med attinere

intellego

613. med is the reading of Reiz, Bothe and Ritsehl, me of the

607. meninpendere,i.e.1sha11
be quite eonvineed that Ι don't
care a fig whether you believe it
or not. Stasimus is by no means
polite to Callicles z see v. 600.

608. quam duflum (‘how
long since ’) occurs in the same
manner as here, instead of quam
clia est eat quo, Asin. 11 4, 453,
quam dudum ΐιι advenisti?
istuc, quod tu dieis.

609. tam modo is attested by
Festus p. 359, 5 as a peculiarity
of the dialect of Praeneste, and
the same I have restored to a
line in the Capt. 882 where
Hegio asks tam modo and Erga-
silius answers νὴ τὰν Πραινέσ-
την. Plautus derides the Prae-
nestine dialect (which had no
doubt a somewhat rustic eha-
raeter) in another passage also,
True. 111 2, 23, where conia for
ciconia is attributed to it, and
Bacch. 24 the Praenestines are
ridiculed as braggards, alm-iusi.
-resg both here and in the
next line, means ‘ fortune‘.

610. fruyalior does the duty

of a comparative offrthi (Publio
School Latin Graminar, ξ 29,
4), srugyalis itself not being used
by the cornio writers or any-
where else. Callicles supposes
that Lesbonicus had arranged
his sister's engagement by a
prudent transaction with Philto
or Lysiteles.

611. For equidem with a third
person see n. on v. 352. ipsus
and ultro jointly express the
same idea: Philto came unasked,
entirely of his own accord, with-
out Lesbonieus taking any step
in the affair.—-oratztmfilio‚ ⁴ to
plead for his son’; the dative
being the so-ealled dat. com-
modi. This sense of orare ap-
pears very clearly in the subst.
orator; comp. e. g. the begin-
ning of the prologue to Terence's
Hauton tirnorumenos.

612. flagyz'tiwn ‘seandal'‚ a
somewhat stronger expression
than rwnfor v. 640.

613. postremo means the same
as quid verbis opust, or ut (uno)
verbo dicam: cf. 662.
