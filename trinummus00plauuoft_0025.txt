PROL. 9—14.] TRINVMMVS. 9

tum illanc mihi esse gnatam voluit Inopiam.

10 sed ea quid huc intro ierit impulsu meo, ιο
accipite et date vocivas auris dum e'loquor.
adulescens quidamst qui in hisee habitat aedibus:
is rein paternam me adiutrice perdidit.
quoniam ei, qui me aleret, nss video esse relicui,

9. tum hanc mihi granatam esse B, tum hanc afitem mihi quavam
esse Sp.; 1 follow R. 10. According to the laws of Plautine pro-
sody it is impossible to pronounce introire as one word and to
sound the 0, but Plautus seems to use it as two words (Ritsehh
Proll. cnx). In those cases where, according'to the ins. tradition,

. the o would have to be sounded. Bitschl proposes to write introcl.
Ι am, however,inclined to avoid this form (which is not supported

'by other evidence) by either admitting slight transpositions or in
other instances assuming hiatus in the caesura. secl ea 71ch quid
intr-od ierit R. Sp. ; Ι have adopted Bothe’s transposition.

huic nomen est comoediae, be-
longs like the present to a pro-
logne of non-Plautine origin.

11. vocivos is the form oon-
stantly used by Plautus and
other archaic writers, instead of
the later vacuus. See, above all,
Munro’s note on Lucr. 1 520
where it is stated that the (1v in
this word does not appear in in-
scriptions before the age of Do-
mitian. The strongest proof, if
any be necessary besides the au-
thority of the mss. ‚ maybe found
in the pun in the Casina 111 1,
13 ST.fac habeant linquam tuae
aedes. AL. qnid ita? Srquom
veniam, vocent (i. e. vaeent);
comp„ in the same play, 111 4, 6,
ut bene vocivas aedisfecistc' m ilci.
Hence also the jocular expres-
sion Pseud. 1 5, 54, sac sis ro-
civas aedis aurium. (See also
Ritsohl, n. Exc. 1 p. 55) sq.)

14. quoniam, not ‘because'
but ‘now that'; the conjunction
is originally temporal, in accord-
anee with its origin, it being:
quom iam.- in my note on Aul.

9 Ι compare the German weil
(Ι might also have quoted Sehil-
ler, Pieeolomini 111 1 clas eisen
‘muss Gesohmz'eclet werden, weil

English since (i. e. originally
sithence) which is still used both

also Voss’s translation of Homer
Il. xi 84 sq. ⁶ U'eil noch morgen
es war, und der heilige tag em-
porstieg, Haftete jegliehesheeres
gesehoss’ with the original text:
ὄφρα μὲν ἠώς ’ἧν-τόφρα μάλ’
ἀμφοτέρων βέλε’ &wrm-0.- qui is
the old ablative=quo and qua,
though it appears also for the
plural quibus—aleret stands in
the dependent clause after the
historieal present video, this
being virtually the same as ridi.
Geppert quotes Bacch. 290 qno-
niam sentio quae res qam-etur,
'navem coetemplo statuimus. An
even stronger deviation from
the ordinary rule is Cio. pro
Quinc-tio v 18 royac ut curet
quod clirisset, where one might
feel inclined to write curaret.
