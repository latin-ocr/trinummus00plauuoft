quibus aerumnis deluctavi, filio dum divitias quaero. 20

novo ornatu specieque simul?
pol quamquam domi cupiO, opperiar: quam hic rem
gerat, animum advertam.

⁵838. dehinc is monosyllabic,
as it always is in Plautus,—
certumst.- see n. on 270.-—The

syni‘zesis otio is admissible in a
somewhat loose mette, like the
present, but not in ordinary
iambic or trochaic lines. The

same observation applies tofilffi
in the next line.

839. The active use of (le-
luctare (instead of the deponent)
is attested by Nonius p. 468,
29, and occurs also in other
passages. —Persa 4 we have
cum leone (and a set of other
ablatives) demetam—The cou-
struction is here: satis partum,
habeo eis aerumnis quibus de-
Ζιισταυί.

840. The anapaestic lines are
calculated to express Charinides'
surprise and gradual retreating
to the backgrouud of the stage.

strange costume and appearance
excite Charmides' curiosity.

841. domi cupio ἐπιθυμῶ οἴκους
so Mil. gl. 801 eins domi cupiet
miser, and ib. 964 cupiunt tui
(this is at least a very probable
conjecture)·. Lorenz observes
that the same construction is
used by Symmachrm, who says
vestri cupiunt Epist. 1 8 in.
The gen. in this construction
denotes the aim towards which
the action is directed—The i
in <lomi is shortened: Introd.

Sc. 11. This is in point of
comio power aud vivid dialogue
the best scene of the whole
play.

843. <liei is the reading of
the mss, but we are no doubt
justified in expressing even in
spelling the symizesis of ei into
e. See n. on Aul. 607. Words-
worth, Spec. of Early Latin.
p. 52. The dative Fmss is found
in an inscription on a cippus
from Picenum C. Ι. L. 1 170
