1. clam added by Ritschl to avoid the hiatus3 Spengel omits it

again.

The argumenta acrosticha of
the Plautine comedies are mosi:
likely the productione of some
grammarian of the seventh cen-
tury v. c., as they bear in their
prosody ‘che impress of that
period in which a great revival
of archaic literature took place
in connexion with 'the gramma-
tical and critical study of the
old language. This is, e.g.‚ the
opinion of O. Seyffert (‘de bac-
chiacorum versuum usu Plauti-
no’ p. 48 where he says: ‘argu-
menta acrosticha Plautinarum
fabularum septimo saeculo non
scripta esse non possunt'>, while
Ritschl (N. Exc. on Pl. 1 p. 122)
appears to doubt this compara-
tively early origin of the acro-
stichs. Besides them, we pos-
sess also five other ‘argumenta'‚
in fifteen senarii each, which
should no doubt be assigned to
the second half of the second
century after Christ: see Bitschl,

Proll. p. cccxvn.

1. Thensaurus is the constant
spelling of the best mss. in Plau-
tus (see also v. 18), andis also
given by Ribbeck's two good
mss. PR in Vir-g. Georg. 1v 229:
cf. his Ind. gramm. p. 434. See
also my note on Ter. Eun. 10.
η had in early Latin and in the
popular pronunciation of all
periods a tendency to creep in
where it was nol: called for ε
so in thensaurus from θησαυρός,
and Mesyalensia for Μεγαλήσια
<the festival of the μεγάλη μή-
mm: see Corssen 1 p. 255, On
'che other hand, η was original
in such words as formonsus and
in the numerals in ensumus and
in many other instances where
we do not find it in the classica]
period (Corssen 1 253 f.). See
also n. on odiossus v. 37.

4. et in the sense of etiam is
foreign to Plautus.
