887. Neither the construction opus-factost viatico nor the expres· .
sionfacere viaticum appears to be 111 conformjty with Plautine usage,
ancl-facto is in all probability corrupt. Perhaps an adjective like
magno was the original reading. Sp. reads opus captost viatico.
888. The reading is very uncertain. vesculus would be a ἄπ. >xe-7„
11 the reading were certain [iuxillum Β, uixillum CD]; it would,
of course, be the diminutive of vescas ‘thin‚ meagre, spare'.
(See the discussion on this word by Ribbeck. Lat. Part. p. 10.)
‘vinarium is used as subst. Poen. 1v 2, 16. The reading of FZ
is vasculum, the dim. of vas, 111 which case vinarium would be
adj. Sp. reads quusi liaeim' vinarium. 839. Our text represents
the reading of the mss„ in which est is used short, as 11 13 in a
great number of passages in Plautus, and tibi appears with its
second syllable long. There is no reason for reading quid istac
est nomen (without tibi), as Ritschl does in opposition to the mss.
Sp. reads quid tibi nomen est.

886. concubium noctis ‘ dead
of the night' is explained by
Varro l. 1. vu 78 α concubitu
dormiendi causa.

887. ‘ut tu praedicas ‘to
conclude from your words'.

889. Paae does not mean
‘ Peace ’ (as I see that the ‘ Old
Westminster ’ translates it), but
is a jocular substitution of the
interjection pax for a personal
name. Cf. especially Ter. Haut.
717,unus est dies, dum amentum
eripio : pant,- nil ampliu-s (quite

different from 291). The inter-
jection is originally Greek, and
is explained by Hesychius (s.v.
πάξ) by τέλος ἔχειε cf. Pl. Mil.

890. cotidianum ‘my every-
day name ’.

891. crediderim ‘had 611111131-
ed to you'.

892. solide ‘out and out':
see v. 850.-By saying quid ais
he solicits the sycophant's at-
tention: ‘I say’; ‘dis donc’.
