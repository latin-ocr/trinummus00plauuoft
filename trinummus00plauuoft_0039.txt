110 suamque filiam esse adultam virginem,

115

simul eius matrem, suampte uxorem, mortuam:

quoniam hinc iturust ipsus in Seleuciam, τε

mihi conmendavit virginem gnatam suam

et rem suam omnem, et illum corrumptum filium.

haec, si mi inimicus e'sset, credo, haud cre‘deret.

ME. quid tu adulescentem, quem essse corrumptum
vides,

qui tuae mandatus est fide et fiduciae,

quin eum restituis? quin ad frugem configis?

Μ

sternere is ‘to bring down low’; cf. Cic. Cluent. VI 15, perfregit
ac prostravit omnia cupiditate ac furore, which is moreover sig-
nificant for our passage when we compare Cicero's persreqit with
confregyz‘t in the preceding line. 111. suompte is Ritschl's
emendation, the mss. reading suamque. The mater and 111ον are
one and the same person, and it seems scarcely possible to ex-
plain que on the assumption of its being used for the Greek δὲ
111 such a sentence as Brix quotes from Herod. vu 10, πατρὶ τῷ
σῷ, ἀδελφῷ δὲ ἐμῷ Δαρείῳ ἠγόρευον. (Bitschl suspects also that
the original reading may have been suum roret-em.- for which
form see on v. 800.) 114. et σόιινιωιψΐιιηι illum filium Sp. against
the mss. The anapaest et ’ῖῖῖιῑιη is quite inadmissible after the

peculiar caesura of this line. O. Brugman, ‘de sen.’ p. 40, thinks

that we should either pronounce et lum or scau et ἱίᾶ, so as to
‘creat the first syllable of illum as short.

112. quoniam: see n. on v. 14
above-in Sclccham: meaning
the province 01 country called
Σελευκίς by the Greeks, comp.
Persia, for Περσίς. See below
845, where Seleucia is men-
tioned together with familiar
names of countries‚ Macedonia,
Asia, and Arabia. The Greek
name of the town is Σελεύκεια,
and if the Latin be derived di-
rect from this, we have here an
instance of the shortening of an
unaccented long syllable, though
even accented long syllables are
in Latin shortened in this way,
e. g. πλατεῖα platea, ’γυναικεῖον
φιηαεεέηηι,βαλανεῖονόα1(ῐ)ηέιιιη,
χορεία chorea. See n. on Aul. 404.

114. corrzmzptm is the archaic
form of 11ιο participle, cf. cor-
rumpier, below 240. In Plautus
the nasal was all the more re-
quired in this form as corruptus
might also be the participle of
corrupto (see v. 83).

115. credo, ‘I trow', is fre-
quently used without direct in-
fluence upon the construction z
eg. Merc. 207 credo, non credet
puter.

117. For 1110 dative. fide (v.
129) see 11. 011 Aul. (307. Ter.
Andr. 296, Eun. 885, 898.

118. quin eum 13 slightly irre-
gular after quid adulescentem
of v. 116: but such sudden
changes in the construction are
