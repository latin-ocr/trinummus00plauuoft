construction is illi est opus multa opera ficturae but is not opera
ficturae a very eurious expression? Ι confess that Berg k’ s reading
seems to be most acceptable. multaest operae opztsfictarae. (Sp.
edits mnltast opera opus fissurae, which Ι think to be far inferior
to Bergk s conj.) 368. This line gives no sense unless we admit
very violent changes of the ms. reading, and even then it might be
difficult to get it into troehaie metre, and it would still be merely
a languid repetition of the preceding line. I have, therefore,
followed Ritschl in bracketing it. Sp. maintains it in the text.
ΜΓ Nettleship (Academy, 111 299) thinks that it is an iambic octo·
narius (sapientiae aetas candimentum, superest aetati cibus),
wrongly introduced into this troehaic passage, though good in
itsels. 369. agidam is the reading of B, ayednm of the other
mSS.; but as this would be quite isolated in Plautus <Bitschl
opusc. 11 563), Ι have not adopted it, though Ritschl does so in
his second edition. 371. The msa give et for ei : but there is
no doubt as to the true reading, though old editors have eius .- see
v. 358.
