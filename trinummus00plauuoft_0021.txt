Spengel writes LVSITELIS, a form of the name repeatedly given
by the mss, BGD. But the instances given by Bfieheler, [srnnclrz'ss
der lat. decl. p. 8, are not exaetly to the purpose, as they do not
show that Greek names in ης ever ended in is in the nom. sing. in
the literary language. Ι have,however‚ followed Spengel in omitting
CANTOR at the end of the list. The cantor was not one of the
characters of the drama, but: merely a member of the troupe 01·
band.
