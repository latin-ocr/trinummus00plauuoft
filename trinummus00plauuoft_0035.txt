79. apsa is given by B and justly retained by Ritschl in his
second edition: see the instances collected in my Introd. to the
Aul. p. v, to ‚which may be added attrito in Β below 152, imma—
nibus in B Poen. v 2, 20, immelina B Epid. 1 l. 22, instances
quite analogous to impriuatmn in the Lex agraria of a. 643, C. Ι. L.

For later mss see Merkel, praef. Ov. Met. p. lx s, and in his vol.
1. p. X111. concollegya (i. e. cum collega) is the reading of the
Medicean ms. of Cic. ad Fam. 1 9, 25.—In the present line, only
the ms. C gives the spelling suspitio, while all the other mSS. give
a o, and v. 82 they agree in giving a c. Numerous other instances
of the spelling with a c are collected by M. Haupt, Hermes 1v p.
147, and the same is defended by Corssen. But as the best mss.
fluctuate in this word, it might seem that the Romans themselves
spelt it either way. (See n. on Aul. 598, which should be moilifiecl
in accordance with the present observations.>

also neuter in accordance nith
its origin from potius (so satis
