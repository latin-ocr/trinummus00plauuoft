emendation, in the absence of anything more probable. ut may
have got here from the beginning of the next line, where it is
quite in its place. 750. sed ut Sp. 753. suaet is the reading
os 1301), situmst of A : but smely the first desei-ves the preference,
as Ι was mistaken in asserting (in blind acceptation of Fleckeisen's
statement) that this word was ouged as a neuter in the Trinummm,
though it 16 used so by Petronius Sat. p. 53 17 Bii. 754. The
relative quenz is very languid in this place, and Geppeit 16 110

Infin. bei Pl. p. 34.

756. erqo igitur is 0116 of
the palpable tautological ex-
pressions in Plautus (cf. 818)
