926. quid ille erqo Sp. after Reiz, against the mss. Even R. has
in this place maintained the ms. reading. 928. The reading is very
uncertain. The authority of the mss. is in favour of Rhaclczmccnwn
in Cecropia insula. but this makes the line too long. Ritsehl has,
therefore, writtenRhadamam, following the analogyof Calc has which
was in Latin deelined after the first as well as the third deelension ε
see Priscian VI 53 p. 239 H. Charis. p. 66 K. Instead of this, Guyet
ingeniously conjectures Ceo-copia and omits ‘Insula as a gloss, where-
by we are enabled to keep the regular form of the accusative. The
Κέρκωπες were renowned in Greek mythology and fairy-lore as
erafty thieves and appeared often as such on the Attio stage: see

beginning of the line is given by the mss. and retained by Sp.
Guyet, R. and others change it into quis.
