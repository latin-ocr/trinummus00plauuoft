AOTVS Ι.

MEGARONIDES.

Amicum castigare ob meritam noxiam
inmoenest facinus, verum in aetate utile

ACT I. Sc. 1. Megaronides
having heard of the calumnies
spread against his friend Calli-
cles and not altogether disin-
clined to believe them, has re-
solved to upbraid and tax him
with his ill demeanour.

noxiam.

24. immoene, i. e. immune.-
comp. moenia (=munia‚ mune-
ra) below 687; Mil. gl. 2283 Rud.
692, and moenera in Lucretius
1 29, 32; v 1306. oe frequently
replaces an older oi and later
ut see Corssen 1 p. 703. (poe-
nire for punire Cic. de rep. 111
9, 15.) The adjective munis
occurs Mero. prol. 105. immoene
facinus is ‘a thankless office '‚
‘quod nemo aut rari dono aliquo
aut beneficio remunerant, pro quo
nemo munis aut munificus est',
as J. F. Gronovius justly ex-
plains the expression in his
Lect. Plaut. p. 337.-in aetate
properly means ‘in the course
of human life’‚ in aetate homi-
num, Rud. 1v 7, 9. Of. below

25. conducibile ‘useful'z Plau-
tus is very fond of these adjec-
tives in hilis: below he has
utibilis instead of the ordinary
utilis (So also Mil. glor. 613 and
in other places). Besides here
and v. 36, he has conducibilis
in five other places, but of other
writers only the Auctor ad He-
rennium seems to use the word
(11 43).-On account of ‘nam
both the Auctor ad Herennium

treatise de inventione 1 50, 95

the earlier work) accuse Plautus

sense, or rather, in order to give
it its proper force, some inter-
mediate thought should be sup-
plied: ‘to upbraid a friend is a
thankless office. I am at pre-
sent under the necessity of per-
formiuy this task, forI am going
to, etc.' On this ⁴ connective '
use of nam see n. on Aul. 27
and 595.
