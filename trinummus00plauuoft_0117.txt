atque aliquem ad regem in saginam si erus se con-
iexit meus,

credo ad summos bellatores acrem—fugitorem fore,

01 capturum spolia ibi—illum qui ero advorsus
venerit.

e'gomet autem, quom extemplo arcum et phare-
tram et sagitas sumpsero,

cassidem in caput—dormibo per-placide in taberna-
culo. 100

ad forum ibo: nudius sextus quoi talentum mutuom

dedi, reposcam, ut habeam 1110011111 quod feram
viaticum.

⁷725. 1 have adopted the reading proposed by C. F. W. Mffller,
Plaut. Pros. p. 253 sq„ which agrees with 1110 mss. except that
they have an additional mihi after arcam. For ssfgssta see Introd.
to Aul. p. XLIV. R. writes έῃοιηοῖ, quom eoetemplo circum et phare-
tram mi 61 saqittas sumpsero. 726. The mss. read placide with a
hiatus which Ritsehl formerly removed by reading placidula,
and in his second edition by placidesl. On these forms see the
Preface. Sp. outherods Herod by reading placide in taber'indeulo.
Surely taberna cannot be treated like τέχνη techina. Fleckeisen
proposes plc'oeicle inda tabernaculo. I prefer reading pcrplacz'de.

word is os diminutival forma-
tion, denoting inferiority; Va-
nicek connects the first part
with the root leals, haul„- [Lat.
cingere] ‘to gird'3 if this 110
right, cucula would properly be
a page that fastens the belt, and
‘girds’ his master's 101110.)-
haud lonqius ‘ at no very dis-
tant time’.

Drager 1 p. 539.—The joke con-
sists in suffitorem being said
παρὰ προσδοκίαν for pugnatorem

or militem; so also in the fol-
lowing lines. Plautus is very
fond of these jokes and employs
1110111 in several passages with
a happy effect. See below, v.

Latin a very common form of
the future of verbs of the fourth
conj.)‚ see Key L. G. §46st

stead of dies, for which see n.
