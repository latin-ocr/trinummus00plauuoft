760 ME.

gerrae: ne tu illud verbum actutum inveneris:

‘mihi quidem hercle non est quod dem mutuom?
CA. malim hercle ut verum dicant quam ut dent

mutuom.

ME. sed vide consilium, 51 placet.

ME. scitum, ut ego opinor,

CA. quid est?

765 ΜΕ. homo conducatur aliquis iam quantum potest,

762. Sp. assigns this line to Mne. and reads dicas and

cles according to the mss.
as follows 2——

ΜΕ.

765 sqq, The mss. read this passage

Homo conducatur aliquis iam quantum potest,

Quasi sit peregrinus. CA. quid is scit facere postea?
ΜΕ. Is homo exornetur graphice 111 peregrinum modum,

Ignota facies quae non visitata sit.

Mendacilocum aliquem: quid is scit facere postea?

Falsidjemn confidentem. CA. quid tum postea?

I follow Ritschl, but Sp. retains all as it is, except that he
removes the interpolation quid is seit facere postea in the fifth
line by introducing a fresh interpolation of his own, est usus

hominem callidum.

759. Megaronides knows very
skilfully how to hint to Calli-
cles that he cannot or will not
advance the money to him.

760. ρεννναε ‘bosh ’, the same
as nuque, 1091, fabulae, somnia.
(This word 15 from the same root
as yerro ‘a fool, clown'‚ and
cerr-itus ‘foolish'. This root
is identical with ‘queer '.)—⁷ze
⁴ surely ³. —- verbum inveneris,
non pecuniam.

761. mihi is placed at the
beginning of the line with great
emphasis, The same beginning
(mihi quidem hercle) 15 quoted
by Brix from Merc. 1v 4, 223
Poen. 1 1, 23. 3, 3; Rud. 1 2,
20.—For the evasive answer it

will scarcely be necessary to
quote similar instances from
Plautus or other writers —
modern instances occur in prac-
tical life.

762. Callicles answers ironi-
cally ‘ 1 would much rather they
spol-xe the truth (i.e. were really
poor) than they should lend me
the money'. This implies that
for their meanness they deserve
to be poor.

763. sed: Megaronides wants
to lead the conversation into
another channeL as the subject
might finally become personal.

764. scitum ‘clevet '.

765. quantum potest ‘as soon
as possible'.
