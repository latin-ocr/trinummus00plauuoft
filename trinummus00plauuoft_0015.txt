many eareful observations, mostly grammatical—and in
some of 111080 Ι 113νο nob 11081131οᾶ 10 317311 myself of 1118
work. Though Ι hope 11131 Ι have always gratefully
acknowledged any 10311 01 labis kind in 1110 proper place,
a general statement should 1101 be omitted in this place 3
but I may also be allowed 10 observe 11131 both Brix and
myself derive 1101 3 small parf of our materials from 1110
old oommentators, from 1110 Lexicou Plautinum of Pareus
(besides which I have also employed Pareus’s useful
Leaeicon Oriticum sive Thesaurus linquae latinae, Norim-
bergae MDCXLV)‚ and from 1110 Iucleoe verborum in the
Delphine Edition 01 Plautus. Ι have also found Weise's
Leoeicou Plautinum very useful, though 11 18 1101 3 111181-

In a text-book for 80110018 and colleges 1110 editor is
1101 called upon 10 perplex his readers with original and

1110 labours 01 1118 predecessors. Ι1 would be over-modest
in me 10 pretend 11131 Ι had made no original observation
whatever 111 1110 present work—those who shall go over
the same ground 38 myself will find 0111 that Ι have con-
tributed my own modest share 10 1110 emendabion and
explanation of 1110 present play,—but 11118 18 merely inci-
dental in a work of 11118 kind, and 1101 118 1113111 feature.

Ever since 1110 publication 01 my edition of the
Aulularia, Ι have considered 11 311 honourable office 10

of German philologieal study. I am proud 10 say of my-
self ‘ nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri) Ι vene-

I have been unable 10 follow 1110 131081 development of
his Plautine 0111101810, and hhough I 03111101 but disap-
prove of 1110 acerbity and harshness of some of his ex-
pressions 3 but I do 1101 care whether my works find
favour in 1110 eyes of his ⁴ SchooL’ Ι 3111 gratified 1ο find
