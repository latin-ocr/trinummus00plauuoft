reading of the other mss. dimisti, which renders the addition oi

ta unnecessary.

qai quidem = si quidem is.)
Having, however, previously
determined to refuse the land,
he does not care to enter into
a discussion of Stasimus' ac-
count, but in his own moralis-
ing manner treats it as a joke.
553. With the expression hos-
pitium calamitatis (ί a place 111
which all calamities are hos-
pitany admitted'), cf. above,
314 damni conciliabulum, and.
the peculiar use of hospitium
below v. 673. For the special
1136 of calamitas comp. also
Cato, de re rust. 35, fabam in
locis validis, non calamitosis
serito. So also praedium cala-
mitosam id. praef. 1. A somewhat
similar joke occurs Amph. 1 1,
140, where the timid Sosia ob-
serves certe advenientem me hic
puyneo hospitio accepturas est.
554. quam ‘cis malam rem
‘anything be it ever so bad’:
see v. 380.—quaeras ‘you may
look for it' and be sure to find it.
555. Philto means that a
slave like Stasimus is sure to
find malam rem (punishment,
especially flogging) both there

where: in fact that he can
never escape from it.

556. arcano should be under-
stood as the dative, not as an
adverb. *Be sure, you have
confided your secret to one that
can keep it.’
⁴ 557. quidem drops its final
m, and thus quidem cupit form
a proceleusmatic together.

558. οε sublinere ‘to cheat’
(comp. the German ‘einen
anschmieren') is a pretty ire-
quent expression in Plautus:
see my n. on Aul. 660.—The
hiatus quoi os should not be
changed against the mss.: cf.
v. 604. This may possibly be
an isolated trace oi the old
spelling quoiei, as Biicheler
thinks, Lat. decl. p. 59. See
also v. 358.

559. For quidem Ῑιένσῑε 366
Introd. to Aul. p. xrvr, n. 2.

560. The hiatus in de ayr(o)
is legitimate: see Introd. Aul.
