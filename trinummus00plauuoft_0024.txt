8 TRINVMMVS.

6 and 7 are considered spurious by C. Dziatzko and Ritschl,
and it should be confessed that they are superfluous after the two
lines which precede, and read like a ‘dittographia' 01 them.·—sim

29—31) gives many instances in
which this archaic interjection
appears at the beginning of a
sentence and before a demon-
strative pronoun. Being an in-
terjection‚ em is as a rule not
elided before a following vowel
(Ritsehl, Opusc. 11 wop—*illaec
and haec [i. e. 'illae-foe and hae
÷ce] are in Pl. the almost con-
stant forins of these two pro-
nouns in the nominative plural
of the feminine—nunciam is in
the comio poets a trisyllabic
word, like etiam and quoniam:
n. on Ter. Andr. 171. iam 1111110
(0. g. Men. prol. 43) is far more
emphatic,

4. erret: lest you mistake us

, for more than we are aud sup-

pose us to 110 characters of the
play itself.—in viam deducere
is an expression chosen in agree-
ment with the notion of errare,
losing one's way.

5. dare, for vos daturos esse:
the present infinitive is frequent-
ly found in the old writers after
verbs of promising and hoping:
see e. g. Ter. Andr. 238, 379
ete. and the other passages
quoted in my Index p. 480.
Instances from Plautus might
be given plentifully: comp.

2, 7 etc. in which it will be
found ‘that sometimes a subject
is added to the infin., and some-
times omitted. This careless-
ness of Latin conversational
language is analogous to the
infinitives present and aorist
after ἐλπίζειν, ὑπισχνεῖσθαι and
similar verbs in Plato: sec my
11. 011 Crito p. 53, 27 (p. 111),
though Madvig (in the first
volume of his Adversaria) is in
favour of changing them into
future infinitives, after the ex-
ample of the Dutch critics, espe-
cially Cobet and Hirsohig.

8. The mention of the name
of Plautus here and v. 19 is at
vai-ianoe with the habit of Te-
rence who in his prologues al-
waysstyles himself merely poeta
without introducing his name.
It is doubtful whether we shall
be justified 111 assuming this
to be the uniform habit of the
whole period, or should allow
an exception in favour of Plau-
tus-Luxuriae is dat: the
0011110 writers have, as a rule,
the dat. after nomen addere,
facere and indere, except 01100
at the end of a line Aul. 162,
and once 111 Ter. Hec. prol. 1 at
the beginning of a line. (See
also Drager 1 400.) The line
