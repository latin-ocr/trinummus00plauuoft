458. I have kept the reading of the mss., though Ritschl
adopts· Hermann’s order nisi me (eliud quid vis, as he considers an
anapaestic word faulty in the second foot: Proll. 221. (Sp.
reads uisi qnid vis me aliud and Brugman, de sen. p. 37, substi-
tutes the archaic alid, which was still used by Catullus. See,
for it, J. Wordswortffs Spec. of Early Lat. p. 94 sq.) But comp.
above, v. 397 miser eat animo* fit etc. But why then does not
Ritschl also change Merc. 728 *illast-etima vis πιῖηιιηι dicam?
where it would be easy enough to read vis &Manu again Persa 372
verum ei rei operam do oze [elii dicant quibus licet (Why not

ei* ‘rei do (iper‹1m.2); see also other passages collected by Brix:
Poen. 111 3, 68; Mil. ,(11. 547, and in Terence Ad. 111 5, 573

Haut. 113; Phorm. v 8, 38.

467, 491, 497) used of social
rank, as we might say ‘circle '.
Brix appropriately compares
Cist. 11 1, 17 neque nos-factione
tanta quanta tto sumus, mque
opes nostrae cum sunt validae
quam tuae.

454. For the genetives mentis
and animi comp. my note on
Aul. 105, where I might also
have quoted Epid. 11 2, 55
sermonis fallebar, though this·
is differently explained by Key,
L. G. ἓ 940.

455. condicio ‘a marriage
offer', and above v. 159.

456. For ferentarium see In-
trod. to Aul. p. xmv (an instance
exactly parallel is εθιῐέητάνὶἰ
sutores Aul. 508); see also
C. F. W. Miiller, ‘ Nachtra‘ge'
p. 37 sq. (158). “According to
Veget. 1 20, the ferentarii were

light troops whom it was usual
to place at the flanks to begin
the fight with slight skirmish-
ing3 according to Varro, de 1. l.
vu 57, and Paul. p. 85 the name
was derived from ferre (auari-
liztm or arma), and here it is
obvious that Plautus thinks of
a ‘helping⁷ friend, ‘a friend in
neesl'.'’ Bmx.

457. abin hinc dierectc ‘go
to the deuce': dierectus occurs
only in Plautus (and once in
Varro's Satires) and is always
pronouneed in three syllables.
See the passages collected in
Ramsay’s Mostellaria, p. 95 sq.
—votare is the Plautine form
for vetare.- Corssen 11 fiel—si
hercle is common instead of
hercle si, cf. n. on Aul. 48.

459. heniynior ⁶ kinder, more
polite ’.
