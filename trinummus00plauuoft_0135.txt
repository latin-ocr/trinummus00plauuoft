in its place a blank for a word of six letters so as to render

879. The sycophant returns
a haughty answer to Char-
mides¹ questions. The iuratores
were the assistants of the censor,
who would naturally put ques-
tions of this kind 101- the pur-
pose of making up their lists.
—recte ‘ according to truth ⁷.

881. unum quidquid stands
apparently for unum quidque,
and, as Brix observes. exactly
the same phrase occurs Ter. Ad.
5903 but these are not the only
passages in which quidquid ap-
pears otherwise than as a rela-
tive: comp. Madvig on Cic. de
fin. v 9. 24.—si719illati7n is the
only genuine form, not sinqu-
latim.

882. eqo saxo scias ‘ ΓΠ in-
form you’ of my name, etc. We
should suppose that the syco-

phant pronounces this line 'm
such a stately and solemn man*
ner as to render Charmides
quite eager to hear his tale.

884. ⁷11a9711mzfacinus ‘ some-
thing very difficult’.-— incipis-
εει-6 occurs also Capt. 11 1, 193

885. hercle is put in the
conditional clause by way of
prolepsis instead of in the apo-
dosis: see the parallel instance
in v. 457.—The sycophant in-
sinuates that he has already
appeared under so many differ-
ent names and in so many cha-
racters, as to possess a large
number of ‘aliases’.-—prim1mn
nomen, ‘the beginning of the
name’, comp. summus mons and
similar expressions.
