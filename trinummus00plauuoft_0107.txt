LE. nullum benfioium esse duco id, quom quoi

facias non placet.

scio ego et sentio ipse quid agam3 neque mens

officio migrat,

LV. quid ais? nam retineri nequeo quin dicam ea

quae promeres—

itan tandem hano maiores famam tradiderunt tibi

tui,

ut virtute eorum anteperta per flagitium perderes
atque honori posterorum tuorum ut vindex fieres?

647. maxime ‘libri cum A : quod non intellego.’ R. ; wzaoeuma
is Bothe's emendation. but Sp. retains the ms. reading—Instead
of stultis, Plautus probably wrote moris (cf. (369), by which we

640. rumori servire ‘to be
the slave of the talk of people',
i. e. to care for it and act so as

regard of rumor should resist
his kind intentions in undue
appreciation of the current
notions of poema—promeres
(zpromereris) is used by the

iugulavit. The expression is,
however, quite isolated.
