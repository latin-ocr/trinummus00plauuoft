427. This line is placed here by A, but after the next line
by the other mss, But pronuper is no word (⁶1naudi'tum sanae-
que rationis plane expers’ says Ritschl), and in spite of even
the most violent changes it is impossible to construe this line
in any way, and besides nempe 427 b. would have no sense, if
Stasimus himself had aheady mentioned the sponsio. Ritschl
(Par. p. 529) has, therefore, justly rejected. these words as a
versified gloss on the next line. &Veise had done so even before
Ritschl. (Sp. places v. 427 before 426, and reads in the first
‘queis depencli’ ‘immo inquito, and then quia spo‘nsionem pro'pter
tute exactus es. I do not believe that this new reading will find
many supporters.)—imnzo enim is the conjecture of Ο. Brugman,

curs in the same way Ter. Haut.
601; mille is in fact always
treated as a subst. by Plautus,
never as an adjective. As a
subst. we find it also in Cor-
nelius Nepos, Cicero (pro Mil.
20, 53; Phil. 6, 5), Horace
(Sat. 11 3, 197), and Livy. See

sq„ and read the chapter in
Gellius 1 16. ——draclzuma is
the usual form in which the
Greek δραχμή appears in the
old writers, as has been elabo-
rately proved by Ritsehl (see
his Opusc. 11 Ind.); cf. Corssen
11 131, and my n. on Ter.
Andr. 451.- &trpezita or rather
tarpessz'ta is the Plautine form
of the Greek τραπεζίτης ‘a
banker’: first vindicated by
Fleckeisen, Ep. erit. p. 13 sq„
then by Ritschl (opusc. 11 Iud.
v. rai-passim). For similar in-
stances of metathesis see my

dissertation on the Aul. p. 14.
—Olympicus Ὀλυμπικός occurs
as a name in Greek writers
also.

426. dc ratione ‘according
to account'. -— dehibere and
praehiberc occur in several pas-
sages in Plautus instead of
debere and praebere ; but as the
mss. vary it would not be wise
to restore these original forms
throughout, as Fleckeisen did
in the second volume of his
Plautus—redditae (sunt), the
construction being as if the
subj. were after all mille dra-
chumae, χίλιαι δραχμαὶ ἀποδεδο-
μέναι εἰσίν, ‘ have been paid’.

427 b. For nempe see n. on
v. 328.—clcspomlere is in this
sense invented by Stasimus ; he
means ⁴ say rather that by bail-
ing him you lost your money’.
de denotes here removal: spon-
dendo demere sibi.
