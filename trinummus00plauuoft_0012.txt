viii PREFACE.

the ending as in the nom. plur. In his new edition of
the fragments of the Tragic poets, Prof. Ribbeck bows
to the authority of Ritschl and enriches his fragments
with a number of final d, even giving Pacuvius his share
of them. It is, therefore, very probable that he will join
Nonius and Ritschl in believing in a nom. plur. laetitias,
though Bucheler (Lac. Dec-Z. p. 17) and Corssen 1 p. 754
are strongly opposed to it.

“I should add some critical observations on various
lines in the present play, were I not conscious of having
already too much tried the patience of my readers. But
they should consider that I am a German, and that
with us it seems to become the fashion to prefix one's
δεύτεραι and τρίται φροντίδες, as well as the after-thoughts
of one's friends, to a moderate-sized book in the form
of a lengthy ‘Oorollarium' or whatever else it may be
called. Not to deviate entirely from this national cus-
tom, I will, while sparing the reader my own renewed
medstations, give him the benefit of the pretty emenda-
tion of my friend Professor A. Kiessling (who has kindly
looked at some of my proofs) in v. 831, where we should
not repeat secus ‘nobilis apud homines from v, 828, but
something seems to have been lost to this effect :—

semper mendjcis modesti s1nt, secl divitibzis molesti.

I would also add that the (anonymous) reviewer of

, Ritsehrs Trinummus in E. von Leutsch's Philoloqisclaer

Anzez'yer 111. p. 314 (probably O. Seyffert) agrees wit-h
me in maintaining possim V. 42 against Ritschl, and that
the same 1·eV1'ewer seems to be right in suspecting a
‘ dittography' in the two lines 763 and 7 64. '

‘⁶ In all other respects I must abide by the book such
as it is. In the present state of Plautine criticism it is
unpleasant to reflect that scarcely any publication can
escape the fate of malevolent criticism, as the tone adopted
by our Plautine critics, great and small, is rapidly ap-
proaching the style of Gruter and Parcus : but there are
some exceptions, and Professor STUDEMUND‚ whose re-
searches on the Ambrosian palimpsest may be said to
mark quite an epoch in the study of mss. and authors
