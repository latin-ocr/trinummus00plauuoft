[H. 2. 12—17.

cetera rape trahe, fuge late.

29012icrumas mi haec quom video eliciunt, quia ego

ad hoc genus duravi hominum.
quin prius me ad pluris penetravi?
nam hi mores maiorum laudant, eosdem lutitant

quos conlaudant. 15

his ego de artibus gratiam facio,
ne inbuas eis tuom ingenium.

294. eis tuom is not in the mss, added by Bitschl. (At the
beginning of the line the mss, read neu colas neu tubuas.)

—tantum fas habent quo is a
constr. like diynus with a fol-
lowing relative sentence.

239. Ritschl justly observes
that the proceleusmatic rape
trabeis intentionauy introduced
by the poet to express the
greedy rapacity of the ‘hiulca
gens’. Cf. Pseud. 138 sq„ rape
clepa tene harpaya bibe es fuye.

290. It has been justly observ—
ed by Brix that Plautus habitual-
ly uses quia after verbs express-
ing emotion‚ e. g. doleo yaudeo
snseenseo lactus sum paveopiyet
pudet, volup est, aeerbumst mace-
ror, vitio verto, lamentor conso-
lor: he quotes Mil. gl. 1327,
quom eyo servos, quando aspicio
hunc, Iacrumem quia (1131111191-
mur. Exceptions to this constr.
are ib. 468, nimis beat quod
commeatus transtinet trans pa-
rietem, and Bacch. 1073, oze
miremini quod 11οη triumpho.
It appears, therefore, that the
sentence beginning with quia
is dependent on lacrumas elici-
unt—duravi ‘I have lived to
see ἰ ‘ duro enim pectore opor-
tet esse qui hoc genus hominum
terre possint?

291. quin, ‘why not': a
common sense of the word, ef.
below v. 1026.—pluris, like the
Greek οἱ πλείονες, is an eu-
phemism for the dead, who
may be supposed to form the
majority. In Aristoph. Eccles.
1073 ’γραῦς οίνεστηκυῖα παρὰ τῶν
πλειόνων means “ a woman risen
from the dead’. In Petronius
42 (p. 46, 12 Biich.) we have
the expression, abiit ad plures.

292. latitare is a ἅπ. λεγ.
which Ritschi was the first to
discover in latitant, the reading
of the mss. Observe also the
alliteration in laudant and luti-
tant.

293. The expression is some-
what ax'vkward. Brix compares
Mil. glor. 576, quam benigne
qratiam fecit ne iratus esset.-
so here qratianzsacio oze *inbuat—
ιΙ charge thee not to imbue
thy nature (inqeninm) with
these wicked pursuits (arteSJ’.
Instances of this phrase are
given by Gronovius, Lect. Plaut.
p. 342, but his collection is not

,properly digested.—de his art.

‘concerning these qualities or
pursuits‘.
