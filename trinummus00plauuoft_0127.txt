820 sqq. Sp. (and Brix in his second edition) consider these
lines as anapaestic meti-e, in which they admit the greatest
metrical and prosodiacal licences. 1 have not seen fit to follow
them in this respect. 820. Salsipotenti Sp. with the mss¹⁷ but
contrary to the rules according to which such a word should be
formed. aetherei Neptuno Scaliger and others, et nerei neptuni

Acr IV. 820. Salipotens is a
ἅπ. Rem—Iuppiter aethereus is

gratas qratia-3, in agreement
with which we should here also

a translation os the Homeric
Ζεὺς αἰθέρι ναίων.

821. In laetus lubens the
copula et is omitted in confor-
mity with the usage of archaic
Latin. The line is very em-
phatic on account of the three-
fold alliteration laetus lubens
laudes and the twofold gratas
gyratisque, the effect of the latter
being also increased by the
paronomasia: cf. Poen. 1 1, 6
quibus pro benefactis fateor de-
beri tibi Et libertatem et multas

understand yratasque gyratis,
assuming a transposition osque.
—- laudes qratisque affere is a
solemn formula in thanking the
gods: cf. Mil. gl. 411; Livy vu
36, 7; Tac. Ann. 1 69.

822. mei and suit are mono-
syllabic.—b0'n53: see Introd. to
Au1.p. xxxan-—mz's is contract-
ed from meis or mii-s (mieis in one
of the epitaphs of the Scipios)
in very much the same way as
deis changes to dia—meae is
again monosyllabic.
