413. frudavi is Ritschl's emendation (Sp. defraudavi? Lus.
em, rucio marumast, but istaec is surely required). The mss,
have either defrudavi (BDa) or defraudavi (AC>: but sruclare
and cqurndare are supported by the best authorities and attested
by Prisc. 1 52 R: see n. on Ter. Phorm. 44. Ritsehl, Par.
p. 541 sq. Corssen 1 660 quotes even srucle for fraude from an

Inscription.

409. This line is omitted in
all mss. except the palimpsest.
The forcible expression divorse
distructi would alone be suffi-
cient to vindicate the Plautine
origin of these words.

410. The molossus fo'rmicis
may be defended with other
instances, sec Ritschl, Proll.
p. cem· ; but accentuations like
this are especially frequent in
the spurious prologues : co'nsen—

cially Men. 102, 7023 Rud. 4431,
8053 Poen. 11 343 111 3, 20. It
is not, therefore, necessary to
writeformvicis tu obicias <Nonius
has so without tu), as Ritschl
did in his first edition—pupu-
νω- as masc. is quoted by Cha-
risius p. 83, 27 Κ. from this
place; in Plautus and in the

earlier writers it is always masc.

411. iu istis rebus ‘in those
things which you enumerate '.
- sumptumst z. absumptum est,
inpensum est, ‘ hasbeen spent';
comp. 414 and especially Mil.
gl. 666 sq.‚ ‘iu mala uxore utque
‘inimico sc· quid sumas, sumptus
est .· In. bono hospite utque amieo
quaestus est quod sumitur. A
later Latin construction would
be with the compound‚ istis
rebus insumptum est.

412. ibidem unci traho.- see
n. on v. 203.

413. istaec ratio ‘your ac-
count’: for this meaning of
ratio see n. on Ter. Ad. 855,
and cf. here v. 417, 8, (9).

414. illud, the whole affair.
.ςὶ sumas ‘if you merely spend ',
leaving all the trouble of ac-
counting for the money to me.
This explanation is also sup-
ported by the forcible position
of tibi and tu at the beginning
of the line, for which we should
supply the antithesis ‘ but it
does to me '.
